                <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/112207898076601628221">+Rob Galanakis</a>  posted this on Google+, and as I started to reply I realized this would be a useful thing to put out to a wider audience.  Or maybe useful isn't the right word - it's just something that bugs me so I want to bloviate about it.  </p>

<p>Hey +Cory Mogk , +Brad Clark, +Steve Theodore , and whoever else in #techart . Has anyone figured out a viable model for reusing Python libraries in Maya, like other Python applications with pip/virtualenv/requirements.txt do? Is there a conversation anywhere?ï»¿</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short answer to Rob's question is : I've tried to go this route, but I couldn't get a virtualenv-based approach to match for my needs.   For the long answer, read on...  </p>
<h2>If You're Not Outraged, You're Not Paying Attention</h2>
<p>Like <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/1/27/python-on-wheels/">a lot of people</a>, I'm pretty unhappy about <a href="http://www.simplistix.co.uk/presentations/python_package_management_08/python_package_management_08.pdf">the state of python environment management</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithvillage.com/files/galleries/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07/thumbs/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07-hero_image-resize-260-620-fill.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.faithvillage.com/files/galleries/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07/thumbs/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07-hero_image-resize-260-620-fill.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>There's no dependable, low-maintenance way for people to distribute things -- or to cleanly install things that depend on other things. Even the best tools are wonky, jacked up scaffolding on layers of older, crummier code.  </p>
<p>The boundaries of any particular piece of Python are porous to begin with, both because of cross imports and also python's magical morphing and monkey patching abilities - but the messy state of the distribution ecosystem makes things far worse than they should be. Figuring out how to correctly set up a new module in this ambiguous environment is treacherous. It's not for nothing that the "easy" installation tools, pip and easy_install between them have 17,000+ questions on StackOverflow!  </p>
<p>The typical <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows">easy_install / pip route</a> is tolerable, more or less, if you're coder, and you live in a *nixy everybody-is-a-coder and everybody-has-a-compiler environment. When you're busy experimenting with different frameworks and shiny new toys that show up on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">the cheeseshop</a>, it's great to get all that cool free stuff with just a a few keystrokes.  But this is "easy" only in the sense that hand editing config files to set up a web server is "easy": if you're technically confident, willing to debug anomalies, and have enough background knowledge to sort of the hiccups you'll be fine. But that's not "easy" for 99% of humanity, that's easy for hardcore nerds.   </p>
<p>The Python distribution ecosystem just isn't... well... Pythonic.  It embarrassingly fails the <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">pythonic principle</a>  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
</pre></div>


<p>since there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076/differences-between-distribute-distutils-setuptools-and-distutils2">at least 4 big toolsets</a> (setuptoools, distutils, distribute and distribute 2) and none of them is perfect. All rely on a mixture of static data and scripts that react to the state of your local machine, so installing stuff can provide different results from different orders of operation or different environment settings.  It also fails both  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    Simple is better than complex.
</pre></div>


<p>and     </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    Complex is better than complicated.
</pre></div>


<p>Since the operations you need to perform are often obscure and obscurely interdependent.  Even on a mac, which (being *nixy) should be a much friendlier environment for the live-install approach, I've had serious nightmares -- <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2013/12/and-i-thought-we-had-it-bad.html">trying to set up Django was like a &amp;!*^#&amp;^$ Kafka novel.</a>  To some degree my bad luck there reflects failure to live up to  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
</pre></div>


<p>because many of the problems come from a welter of competing installation scripts and tools that are constantly trying to make things "easy" for one application in ways that make them harder for others.  </p>
<p>To be fair, the Python universe is so diverse that it's almost beyond the possibility of rational management : a big product like <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-4.2-to-4.3/updating-package-dependencies">Plone </a>can involve literally hundreds of dependencies including a mix of python and compiled code that has to run on dozens of platforms.  Even if 99% of them install flawlessly, the remainders still add up to (at best ) a long, frustrating afternoon of  head-scratching, doc-reading forensics.  It's DLL hell all over again.  </p>
<p>It's enough to make you long for a blankety-blank InstallShield wizard.   </p>
<p>On the receiving end, things are just as confusing and intimidating.  Because Python is so multi-platform, lots of packages expect you to be able to compile your own binaries, which is rarely a trivial undertaking even for coders (at least, for people who don't do much non-python programming) and is petrifying for end users. More dangerous, though, is the fact that not everybody does a great job of tracking their own dependencies or knowing their own requirements.  If package X will works with version 2.1 of package Y, but not with 2.2  upgrading Y to 2.35 will break X.  And  of course Y 2.35 might have come along after the author of package X has moved on to other projects.  And Y 2.2 may be required by package Z, and get upgraded automatically when you grab Z to check it out.  </p>
<p>All of this puts us in the rotten position where installing something new has the potential to break existing code. The user is the one who has to figure that out and work around it, and the fix is often "you can't do this and that in the same install unless you write a patch yourself."   </p>
<p><a href="https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/1.0.1/">pip</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076/differences-between-distribute-distutils-setuptools-and-distutils2">buildout</a> do a heroic job of trying to organize all this chaos. However the underlying problem is _extremely _hard, because the foundations are shaky. You've got decades' worth of code, full of shadowy, hard-to-track dependencies, made by hundreds of different hands with widely varying levels of care and forethought.  The  requirements for packages may not even be clear to their authors: do you know every nuance of the version differences in the packages you rely on? Do you always know when you're exploiting a behavior that the developers don't like and want to change?   </p>
<p>Hell, I cannot honestly say that for my <em>own</em> code all the time.  </p>
<p>The short version of all this: being able to install stuff is not the same as maintaining a healthy environment.  Just ask all your older relatives whose machines sport seventeen different internet toolbars.  </p>
<h2>Habitat Crisis!</h2>
<p>If that all sounds bad... well, in the technical art / Maya context, it's <em>worse</em>.  For a couple of reasons:  </p>
<p><a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/habitat_for_two_manatees_bumper_sticker-r4dabf424d562476183df7d3644afd8f8_v9wht_8byvr_512.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/habitat_for_two_manatees_bumper_sticker-r4dabf424d562476183df7d3644afd8f8_v9wht_8byvr_512.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First, and most importantly, artist users are aren't going to accept a "real" command-line-and-text-file based system on their own, even if we had one. That means the TAs have to do it ~~automagically~~ remotely, which is a non-trivial tech challenge.  All too often 'remote installation' translates to 'send some poor sucker running around typing stuff for the artists while they everybody stands around waiting to get back to work.'   And wait till the next big update happens when somebody's on vacation; suddenly they're out of sync with the rest of the team and generating weird issues that are hard to debug. A first class ticket to 'It works on my machine' land!  </p>
<p>All tech support is made more difficult by a diversity of environments: that's why console games are easier to make than PC games even though the underlying tech is the same.  Asking your artists to maintain their own Python ecosystem is like asking your teenage kids to clean their rooms: if they do it at all, it won't be done that well enough to justify the arguing you need to get it done at all. It's hard enough to get a big art team to stay in sync with simple stuff like 'always get latest in perforce' or 'set this environment variable'.   So... managing a complex programming environment?  </p>
<p>In a shell window?  </p>
<p><em>Seriously?</em>  </p>
<p>To some degree this is a moot point: no matter your preferences, you might not have the kind of access you need to use python's admin level tools anyway.  If you have to work with outsourcers, as I do,  you don't have the option of ~~forcing your users at gunpoint~~ empowering your users to manage their own setups. In a lot of places (China especially) you can't count on the end user having admin privileges (thus, no writing into the Maya directory) or always-on internet access (thus, no pip/easy_install).   </p>
<p>Even if you have the rights, it might not be a good idea.  Outsource teams don't like having to reconfigure their whole workspace to accommodate a client who is here today and gone tomorrow. They want a clean, disposable, drop-in setup that they can turn on and off quickly.  A nice discrete footprint removes a lot of hassle from the relationship.  Done properly, it also saves a lot of remote support time and money.  Simplicity pays.  </p>
<p>That's true even for pure in-house development: any company that supports multiple teams needs the same flexibility to swap out toolsets easily without going deep into machine- or user-level configuration. At work I have people hopping between two or three distinct toolsets during an ordinary day, and it's vital that they can do this without wasting time or thought on how things like setting setting all sorts of environment variables or remembering to launch Maya from the right command line.  </p>
<h2>Save the Endangered Pythons!</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/blog/uploads/zombie.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://www.kingsnake.com/blog/uploads/zombie.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>All this adds up to a some pretty stark requirements for Maya python tools:  </p>
<ol>
<li>You want a Python environment that's uniform for all your users</li>
<li>You want to be able to have more than one environment side by side</li>
<li>You want your environments to be easy to distribute - and easy to delete </li>
</ol>
<p>In the wider Python world, this would automatically make you think <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a><em>.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> is the most popular solution to the messy round-robin of versioning, dependency management, and distribution.  While it's all sorts of sophisticated under the hood (here's some <a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-reverse-engineering-ian-bicking-s-brain-inside-pip-and-virtualenv-4899496">details here</a>) it's conceptually very simple: cut all the crap and just make a separate Python for every project, containing exactly what we need!  Throw in <a href="http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/">pip </a>- the best-of-a-bad-lot installer tool that makes installing new modules as good as it's likely to get - and you can quickly create and populate lots of clean environments and populate them. Or use <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout </a>to create precisely controlled setups that have exactly what you need this time.  It's brilliant, Gordian-knot-cutting solution that replaces the incredible complexity of package management tools --  albeit at the cost of lots of duplicated code on disk. Disk space, however, is far cheaper than debugging time and tech-support hand holding.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've never been able to figure out how to get a running Maya to use a virtualenv at runtime. The Maya application appears to be it's own python interpreter (you can verify this by checking _sys.executable _in your command window, or just by renaming mayapy.exe and noting that Maya still works fine).  Which means that virtualenv's main trick -- recursing up from the physical location of the python executable -- isn't going to work correctly.  We don't want to try copying Maya itself and all of it's zillions of dependencies  -- a hefty half-gigabyte or so --for every new project.  And even if we do, the licensing engine does actually care if you're running from the default install directory (at least, it's never let me get away with copying maya to a new location even on a licensed machine).  </p>
<p>Effectively, Maya already <em>is</em> it's own virtualenv . That's why you can have other versions of Maya running independently of other Pythons installed on your machine.  Which is nice and all  -- but no help for the problem of creating a cleanly isolated toolsets for your Maya users.  </p>
<p><a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/our_product_use_sustainable_buzzwords_bumper_sticker-r2e739ef8d9874e7f90d354212bf488aa_v9wht_8byvr_324.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/our_product_use_sustainable_buzzwords_bumper_sticker-r2e739ef8d9874e7f90d354212bf488aa_v9wht_8byvr_324.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>After banging my head against this for a while - I'm <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16678334/virtualenv-and-maya">not the only one who's tried it</a> - I've switched to a tactic that has most of the same properties as the virtualenv but is more Maya-friendly.  I try to replicate the same level of isolation with a rather higher level of uniformity (OK, let's be honest here: I mean <em>fascistic control</em>) over what my users get.  </p>
<p>While I'm not convinced its the distribution system to end all systems, I'm fairly happy with it - it's definitely been the least troublesome, lowest maintenance setup I've administered over the years, and it's worked pretty reliably for me both in and out of house.  I'll describe it a soon-to-be-completed followup post.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, allow me to say that looking at lots of bumper stickers while seeking funny graphics for your blog is a speedy way to dim your faith in humanity. <em>Not recommended.</em>  </p>

                    Your weekly moment of Python-is-awesome
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>I stumbled across a cool little idea while working on a refactor of my python tools build system, and although it is not really ready for prime-time it's fun enough I had to share.  With a little bit of work you can <em>load Python modules directly over the web via http!</em>  How cool is that?  </p>
<p>In the past I've always gave users a userSetup.py which automatically downloads a zip file containing all the rest of my code from a net share. While this works quite well, the userSetup file itself is a bit of a weak link. Although it changed pretty rarely, it was a bit more complex than I liked. In an ideal world, the user setup would be just a couple of lines, highly resistant to breakage and easy to leave untouched for months or years.  All the changeable stuff should happen off in the ether, so users always get the latest hotness.  </p>
<p>While pondering how to improve this, I was trolling Doug Hellman's invaluable <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/">Python Module of the Week</a> site and stumbled onto his discussion of <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/sys/imports.html">custom Python module finders</a>. Basically, a module finder is a class which you can register with python to tell it how to look for modules. The key word there is 'how', not where' -- a module finder can do anything it wants to find or create a module, as long as it has returns an object with a load_module method that python can use to actually pop the code into sys.modules. It's particularly cool because the process is <em>completely transparent</em> to the calling code: if you call  </p>
<p><code>import XXX</code>  </p>
<p>you'll get XXX, even if your custom finder/loader had to generate it by consulting the _I Ching _and waiting for the right phase of the moon.  </p>
<p>That sounds like fun (jeez, my sense of fun has gotten pretty esoteric). So, I hacked up a highly experimental example of a module loader that will look on the web for a python module being served up via http and import it as if it were local.  </p>
<p>Here's the first bit, the module finder which is in charge of looking for the code when somebody says <code>import xxx</code>:  </p>

<p>The module finder's job is to be pointed at a path (in this case, 'self.url') If the path is not something this finder knows how to handle, it raises an ImportError. Otherwise, it sticks around until Python calls find_module with a module name, at which point it will return a module loader object (see below) or None if it doesn't know what to do.  </p>
<p>In this case, we do everything as simply as possible. The finder only works on a path with 'http' in it (note that's not really the right way to check for a url! It's enough for proof of concept, though). The finder just fills out the path with the name of the module (plus ".py") and tries to download it into the user's temp directory. The business with the hex numbers is just a crc check to make sure that the downloaded module is the latest version. If this is the first time you've grabbed the file -- or if the code on the server has changed  -- the cached copy will be refreshed.  </p>
<p>The second half of the operation is the WebLoader, which loads the cached module:  </p>

<p>A moduleloader can do all sorts of fancy things (the test code on PyMOTW, for example, loads a module from a python shelf database) but in this case I'm doing the simplest thing possible, which is to use imp.load_source on our cached python file. imp, if you're not familiar with it, is a super useful built-in module which provides access to most of the internals of python's import process). Actually using the code is the cool part. All you need to do is to register the finder with sys.path_hooks and then add the web server with your modules on in to your path:   </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path_hooks</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">WebFinder</span><span class="p">)</span>  
<span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/python/compression/huffman&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># with the url on the path, just use import  </span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">Example</span>  
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">Example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__path__</span>  
<span class="c1">#[&#39;http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/python/compression/huffman/Example.py&#39;]</span>

<span class="c1"># the module&#39;s __path__ will point at the url, but __file__ points at the cached  </span>
<span class="c1"># file on disk</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This isn't really something I'd be comfortable using in production without more work.  There's no security and no authentication, so not only is your code up on the web for anybody to see, you're also executing code off the web with no idea what it will do. It would be OK for an intranet if you were pretty sure none of your coworkers fancies him/herself a master prankster, but I'd slather on the security before trying this over long distances!  </p>
<p>Another obvious improvement would be to figure out a how to diff the local version of the file against the version on the http server without actually downloading the whole thing; that would be simple if the server could be asked for the CRC directly, but it would mean a tighter coupling between the finder and the server (which might be a good thing, security wise).  Another improvement might be to hack the loader so it force reloaded the module if the server version had changed, although that could have unintended side effects.</p>
<p>The point, however -- assuming there is one --  is how freaking awesome python's infrastructure is. Live loading of code over the net, transparent to all your other code, in about 50 lines?  Hats off to Guido.   </p>

                <p>I've started a <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/tecsurgui-20">page</a> with links to books that TA's would find interesting or useful. Let me know if you've got recommendations - right now there's a glaring lack of Max related books. I've been skipping over "How to do X in Max 2011" type titles so far since they get dated so quickly (I've got probably 200 lbs of utterly useless reference on versions of Maya and Max that wouldn't even run on Windows 7 stuffed into my basement). But I'm always interested to hear about useful reference stuff.   </p>

            <a href="http://theodox.com/2014/no_soup_for_you" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to No soup for you, userSetup.py">
                <h2 class="post-title">
                    No soup for you, userSetup.py
                </h2>

                <p>When I start working on <a href="multiple_mayapy_management_mania">isolating maya environments,</a> I came across a nice bit of trivia I didn't know about.  </p>
<p>If you ever want to run a Maya without its <em>userSetup.py</em> and without having to move or rename files, it turns out you can suppress userSetups by setting an environment variable called <code>MAYA_SKIP_USERSETUP_PY</code> to any value that evaluates as <code>True</code>.  This is handy for testing and isolating path management problems - if you've got a rogue path and you're not sure where it's coming from, this is an easy way to make sure it's not being added in by the userSetup.  </p>
<p>PS: If you're using a <a href="multiple_mayapy_management_mania">MayaPyManager</a> to run mayapy instances, you can set this variable like so:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">mayaPyManager</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">MayaPyManager</span>  
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="n">env</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">()</span>  
<span class="n">env</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;MAYA_SKIP_USERSETUP_PY&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1&#39;</span>  
<span class="n">mgr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MayaPyManager</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;path/to/mayapy.exe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;path/to/maya/scripts&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>  
<span class="c1"># this manager will use only the user provided path  </span>
<span class="c1"># and won&#39;t run the userSetup.py on startup</span>
</pre></div>
