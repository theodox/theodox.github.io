    <p>Going over the last post about <a href="python_in_unity.html">Python + Unity</a>, I did a clean install to make sure the steps I was describing were working correctly and it reminded me about an inportant bit I&#8217;ve left out: how to get the Python stdlib into your Unity&nbsp;IronPython  </p>
<p>Because Microsoft was the sponsor of the original IronPython project, versions that Microsoft released (including the 2.6.2 that i linked to in the last post) <strong>don&#8217;t include the stdlib</strong>, which comes with it&#8217;s own license that clashes in some mysterious way with <span class="caps">MS</span>&#8217;s licensing terms (even though both <span class="caps">MS</span> and the Python Foundation are giving the stuff away for free&#8230; _<em>_sigh</em>). So to dance around that, they did not include the stdlib &#8212; the &#8216;batteries included&#8217; &#8212; with base&nbsp;install.  </p>
<p>The remedy is simple - grab a copy of the regular python stdlib from a python 2.6 series install and copy it into the /Lib folder next to the location of your IronPython <span class="caps">DLL</span>.  I found it simplest to grab the Python26.zip folder from my Maya install and to expand that into the folder.  I did leave the 3 or 4 files that IPy had installed there on its own intact, I believe &#8212; on pure intuition &#8212; that they are different from the corresponding files in the standard python&nbsp;lib.  </p>
<h2>Caveat&nbsp;emptor</h2>
<p><span class="caps">FWIW</span>, this is a good place to point out that some small percentage of stdlib modules don&#8217;t work under IronPython (an unfortunate example being the handy <code>csv</code> module for reading comma-delimited data files).  <span class="caps">AFAIK</span> there is no authoritative list of which modules do and don&#8217;t work under Ipy. The good news is that, for this application , there is almost always a dotnet native solution to use as an alternative without having to install anything&nbsp;else.  </p>
