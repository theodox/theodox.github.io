Character Rigger's Cookbook
============================

These are the slides for a 2-hour introductory rigging course I did at the [GameDevelopers Conference](http://gdconf.com) in 2006.  Unfortunately the original powerpoints are lost to time and tech rot, so all I have is the jpg dump of the originals.  This makes them a bit slow the first time you cycle through, and you can't search on text.  Eventually I plan to go through and add more detaile text to the slides, but for the time being you can go to the [GDC Vault version of the original audio](http://www.gdcvault.com/search.php#&category=free&firstfocus=&keyword=character+rigging%2Bbest%2Bpractices&conference_id=) (_note: subscription required_)and follow along with the original presentation 

Use the discussion links at the bottom of each page to ask questions. If you see a question there that you can answer, chime in! This is all about sharing information.

There's also a nice write-up of the original presentation [here](http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/columns/events/gdc2006/articlee9d2.html?id=655)

Anway, [here's the slides.](01.md)  Enjoy!
