Character Rigger's Cookbook
============================

These are the slides for a 2-hour introductory rigging course I did at the [GameDevelopers Conference](http://gdconf.com) in 2006.  Unfortunately the original powerpoints are lost to time and tech rot, so all I have is the jpg dump of the originals. However the info is the same, so enjoy
