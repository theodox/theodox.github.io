                    Save The Environment 2: I am the .Egg Man
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>In my last, <a href="save_the_environment">bumper-sticker-laden post</a> I offered to share a little bit about the way I pack up my tools for users.  This time I'll try to actually describe the process.  </p>
<p>After a all the buildup, I wish I could make this sound more high tech and impressive. Basically, I just pack up what I have and send it all out to my users in a big ol' zip file.  The zip ends up on their Maya's PYTHONPATH, and gives them exactly the same stuff I had when I created the zip.  That's kind of it.  It's basically a simplified version of a <a href="http://mrtopf.de/blog/en/a-small-introduction-to-python-eggs/">python egg</a>; however since I'm distributing an entire ecosystem in one shot I've opted to do the packaging myself instead of relying on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> and all of its complex dependency management arrangements.  </p>
<p>Simple as it is, this system has saved me a huge amount of time and energy over the last few years. It's been a long time since I've had to worry about a mysterious import failure or the wrong version of a module.  Simplicity and robustness are very important, especially in the foundation of a pipeline. Of course, they don't always make for the most engaging blog posts  But I'll do what I can, even if it means resorting to some pretty lame egg puns.  </p>
<h2>You can't make an omelette without...</h2>
<p>There actually are some details worth discussing, but before I get into them, I should talk about why this works for the special case of Maya tools - and why it might not work as well for other forms of application development.  </p>
<p><a href="http://gabrielutasi.com/copyright/gabrielutasi/052307.egg.gif"><img alt="" src="http://gabrielutasi.com/copyright/gabrielutasi/052307.egg.gif" /></a></p>
<p>My primary problem - the thing I worry most about - is <strong>making sure that all my users are running the same code at the same time</strong>.  Maya tools are hard enough - it's tough to really nail things down when your data structures are just lying around in the scene where users can poke at them.  Between that and the inexorable tick-tock of the game development  clock, I've gotten very resistant to  debugging problems I already solved a week or a month ago and which are only showing up because Jane/Joe Artist doesn't like downloading the latest tools.  </p>
<p>Similarly, it needs to be <strong>hard for an end user to delete or mangle vital stuff</strong>.  I've had artists at a former company who decided to "speedup their startup time" by deleting the file that downloaded the latest tools - a fact which only came to light when their out-of-date data started bringing down nightly builds.  Most users have a few scripts or tools of their own, but I'm not keen on having unvetted stuff from the intenet being dumped into the same folder where all my tools live - there are lots of ways that can go wrong.  </p>
<p>Another thing that's also important is that the system needs to be <strong>clean</strong>: it has to be easy to install and to uninstall, and easy for users to switch between toolsets.  I've got to support multiple teams in house and outsources and I don't want to worry about micromanaging hundreds of files on other people's disks.  </p>
<p>The last  thing I need  to do is to keep this system <strong>independent of our internal source control</strong>. Source control's real job -- managing change over time -- is hard enough.  Using it as a cheapo distribution service is pushing it into a role it's not intended for.  For one thing, many users have reasons (sometimes good, sometimes bad) for opting out of the daily sync ritual.  I don't want my users dropping out of sync with the rest of the team on purpose or by accident -- but I'm also leery of forcing them to sync at a time they didn't choose, since I don't know what they're up to or what other people may have checked in.  Plus, we don't always give outsourcers direct access to source control and I don't want to have to maintain different systems in and out of house.  </p>
<p>Besides,  I want to be able to use source control selfishly, to make my own job easier.  I want to track my development and have the ability to debug or roll back or branch as I need while working, without worrying that checking in the wrong file will bring my whole team to a halt.  I once had a team of 80 artists brought to a screeching halt by a guy who checked in a maxScript file that was auto-synced by everybody in the building. Unfortunately, he did it from a unicode text editor - and Max hates unicode in maxScript. The auto-sync, keep-everybody-current system gave everybody the crashing file straight from his incautious checkin -- and, of course, it broke their auto-syncing as well as killing their Maxes. Since then I've been pretty leery of using source control to get things into users' hands.  </p>
<h2>How to lay an egg</h2>
<p>It's the sum of all these considerations that gives rise to the method I use -- which is, as I said, just zipping up a complete environment and distributing that directly to users via a net share or an http server.  </p>
<p>The zip comes with a userSetup.py that checks the shared drive for newer versions and grab it if needed and then adds the zip file to the user's PATH.  <em>Rocket Science FTW!</em>  </p>
<p>This system satisfies most of my key concerns at a shot:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It's all one piece (well, two if you count _userSetup.py). _That means that every user has exactly the same code - and there are no out-of-date .pyc files lying in wait to confuse things.</li>
<li>Keeping people up to date is automatic</li>
<li>It can be delivered to a user's personal maya directory - no need to touch the base Maya install</li>
<li>It's outside of source control</li>
<li>It's easy to adapt for multiple projects.  userSetup can check an environment variable to decide between multiple zips, and the zips can coexist happily with each other.</li>
<li>It's trivial to remove: there are no permanent alterations to the local filesystem or the maya installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most complicated bit - and "complicated" here is a pretty relative term - is making sure that the zip file is exactly equivalent to the folder structure I use when I'm developing. My project folder looks more or less like this:  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Z9srlWTbMA/U7YY-sLus2I/AAAAAAABIZI/7f4yysrcJA4/s1600/folders.png"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Z9srlWTbMA/U7YY-sLus2I/AAAAAAABIZI/7f4yysrcJA4/s1600/folders.png" /></a></p>
<p>Most of this is what you'd expect: the .py files are modules, and the folders with the little dots in them are python packages. As long as my project folder is on the Python path, these are all available for import in the usual way.  The mildly interesting bit are the folders highlighted in green; those are external modules like PyMySql and Perforce, which I keep separately so I can manage the legal mumbo-jumbo that comes with redistributing and licensing.  In this example 'external' is not a package (note the blue parent folder - my IDE paints them blue if they aren't on the python path) so none of these packages are going to be on the python path or available for import without a smidge of extra work.  </p>
<p>On my own machine, where I'm running from loose files, I add project to my Python path using the wonderful, and often overlooked standard library module site.  site is an alternative method of managing your Python search path - instead of appending paths onto sys.path, you can add directories using using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html">site.addsitedir()</a>.  The truly excellent feature of site, though, that it's data-driven: when you add a directory with site.addsitedir(), the module will search the folder for text files with the .pth extension and then add any directories specified there as well.   That UL_maya.pth file down near the bottom of the picture is my .pth file: it includes entries for my external modules so that they are automatically included when my project folder is added to the path.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, site does not know how to deal with pth files inside a zip file.  So, my startup code includes a little shim which duplicates the functionality of <code>addsitedir</code>. Luckily it's pretty simple:  </p>

<p>This way, adding the whole environment just requires calling <code>include_site_files()</code>. Under the hood the Processor classes will read the .pth files and process them the same way <code>site.addsitedir</code> does: adding named folders to the python path, ignoring comments, and executing imports.  </p>
<p>I don't use that auto-import functionality right now but it would work nicely if you wanted to create a self-registering plugin system where each plugin was a zip of its own.  If you were feeling adventurous, you could bootstrap your whole Maya toolset by adding an import statement to the end of a .pth file in the zip.  As I said, that's not what I do right now -  I currently call my main bootstrap routine from userSetup.py,  since I'm habitually averse to relying the side effects of imports for important jobs.  </p>

<p>It's userSetup.py that provides the  actual link between the zip file and a running copy of Maya. I like to keep it as simple as I can, since it's the hardest part of the system to update.  All it really needs to do is download the latest zip file (from a shared network drive  or via http)  and shim it in with site.addsitedir.  Here's a very simple example:   </p>

<p>You'll note that nothing is really going on here: just download the zip, add it to the path, and call the bootstrap module. End of story.  </p>
<p>This is because you want to keep all the real work inside your bootstrap module. If you try to do anything fancy in userSetup itself, you have to worry about version drift: what happens if the contractor machine in the corner gets turned on after a year of downtime, with a userSetup that's many versions behind?  Moreover, you have no way of preventing users from messing with userSetup for their own reasons: if the code is simple, it's much less likely to be broken by an adventurous artists.   </p>
<p>The bootstrapper module itself is where all of the complex work takes place:  it knows how to unpack the binary resources like plugins or icons from the zip file if they have changed,  how to turn on persistent scriptJobs , and how to load menu items -- all the zillions of things you want to do when you set up you environment. Since it provides a single entry point, it's a great opportunity to put some order and discipline into your setup process: it's far safer than importing dozens of tools or modules in a long userSetup that's not versioned or updated centrally.  </p>
<p>You might notice that all the information needed by userSetup is stashed into environment variables. That makes it easy to boot different environments by launching Maya with the right settings; it's easy to give the users batch files which launch the correct versions of the tools by just setting the variables correctly. This has the nice side effect of supporting nonstandard locations transparently - there's always that one artist who insists on keeping things on an X: drive to consider.  It's easy to see how this could be done with config files rather than env vars, the logic is so simple that the details hardly matter.  </p>
<p>One evolutionary step forward I haven't used in production is to move the userSetup / zip pair to a <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/01/mayas-mildy-magical-modules.html">Maya module</a>.  That would allow for more complex arrangements such as a shared core environment with branch or project specific additions; it would also mean that toolset management would be done by enabling or disabling modules rather than swapping environment variables.  The main hassle would be the fact that a user could simultaneously enable more than one toolset and get random results, since you could never be sure which version of a given module you were getting. It might work better as an outsource-friendly mod than as a replacement for the variable-swapping setup.  </p>
<h2>Hot times in the hen house</h2>
<p>The zipped environment is created by a simple Python build program.  There's not much magic here either.  The build script runs unit tests and aborts the packaging process if they fail.  If the tests pass, the builder gets the latest versions of any external resources (like icons, or binary plugins), and strips out some stuff like unit tests that doesn't need to get to the users.   I add a little bit of metadata -- basically, a text file -- to the zip so I can quickly find out which distribution is running; this is a great way avoid those headsmacking "I fixed that bug a week ago, but user X hasn't restarted Maya in two weeks" mysteries.   </p>
<p>One nice refinement that we discovered almost by accident is using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/py_compile.html">py_compile </a>module to pre-compile the whole shebang before packing.  Our system ships only pyc files instead of pys.  This speeds up load times and slims down the zip file by a noticeable amount. However the most important thing it does is make sure that every module - even those with no unit tests, which are alas too numerous - is at least minimally importable. py_compile will complain if it encounters a module with a syntax error that cannot be compiled. Over the years this has saved me countless small humiliations by making sure that stupid typos and oversights don't result in a busted Maya.  </p>
<p>These days I use a little python program which polls my GitHub repositories for changes and tries to create a new build when a checkin is pushed to the master branch.  The server handles running multiple builds for different Maya versions: When Autodesk rev'ed the version of Python inside Maya, it meant that we needed different .pyc's for different versions of Maya. For most of the last several years, though,  I simply used a zip script from a command line or as an external tool in my IDE and that answered fine for most purposes.  Moving to a server is just a way of making it more painless for a team to do the right thing automatically instead of appointing one person as 'build master' and making them sync and push the button to start a build. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extra credit: Can you guess who the build master was, and why he decided to write the server?   </p>

<h2>Hatchlings</h2>
<p>One problem I don't have to solve for this application - but one which looms very large in the setuptools-distutils-easy_install end of Pythonland - is dealing with a diversity of OS's and hardware.  I'm happy not to try to deal with things like recompiling a slew of C extension modules for DEC-Alpha chips running OS/2 or whatever. I've only got Windows users currently (though pretty much everything I write works on OSX, since I often develop on my laptop).  This removes, for me, the primary appeal of the traditional python distribution pipeline, which is the option of automatically creating whatever esoteric binaries you need just by typing a few lines at the command prompt.  </p>
<p>The price for not letting users compile on their machines is that I have to pre-package the right binaries. To the extent that I can, I end-run around the problem by using pure python modules in preference to binary alternatives, such as using <a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL">PyMySql</a> in preference to MySQLdb, or elementTree instead of <a href="http://lxml.de/">lXml</a>. Inevitably, this does give away some performance (rarely so much that I'm bothered by it) but it hugely enhances portability.  The unavoidable exceptions are things like Maya plugins or the Perforce API, both very finicky about OS and bit-depth; these have to be distributed as part of my zip files and extracted at startup time.  The bootstrapper module includes a manifest which tells it which files to use for which Maya/OS/bit-depth combination, and uses that info to makes sure that things get delivered to the right place.   </p>
<p>The only complication I've run into is that a user (often, me) is may be running multiple maya sessions, and a later one may want to unpack a new version of a binary plugin while an older session is still using a previous version. Unsurprisingly, you can't overwrite the old one since Maya is using it. I haven't quite figured out what to do in that situation, beyond displaying an error dialog and suggesting that the user restarts all of the Maya instances using the same plugin.  For the time being the overlap between tool changes and multiple Maya sessions is rare enough that I tolerate it. It would be possible to dump things into a temp directory in that case, but honestly it sounds like overkill even to me.  </p>

<h2>Counting your chickens</h2>
<p>So, that's kind of it. It's not very sexy but it's been extremely useful for me over the last 4 years - the amount of mystery which this system removed from my life is uncountable.  Because the actual code I use is pretty tied up with work-specific problems, I have not ventured to make a cleaned up, genericised version for public consumption so far, though if there were a lot of interest I could probably whip up a cleanroom version.  </p>
<p>Hope other folks find this one useful. I know it's certainly ~~accompanied~~ saved my bacon !  </p>

<p>The short answer to Rob's question is : I've tried to go this route, but I couldn't get a virtualenv-based approach to match for my needs.   For the long answer, read on...  </p>
<h2>If You're Not Outraged, You're Not Paying Attention</h2>
<p>Like <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/1/27/python-on-wheels/">a lot of people</a>, I'm pretty unhappy about <a href="http://www.simplistix.co.uk/presentations/python_package_management_08/python_package_management_08.pdf">the state of python environment management</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithvillage.com/files/galleries/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07/thumbs/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07-hero_image-resize-260-620-fill.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.faithvillage.com/files/galleries/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07/thumbs/acf1e1575cba5c2dcbb9966017bab1622c3bfee9-7aaec91bedc07579a475225ff6467f07-hero_image-resize-260-620-fill.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>There's no dependable, low-maintenance way for people to distribute things -- or to cleanly install things that depend on other things. Even the best tools are wonky, jacked up scaffolding on layers of older, crummier code.  </p>
<p>The boundaries of any particular piece of Python are porous to begin with, both because of cross imports and also python's magical morphing and monkey patching abilities - but the messy state of the distribution ecosystem makes things far worse than they should be. Figuring out how to correctly set up a new module in this ambiguous environment is treacherous. It's not for nothing that the "easy" installation tools, pip and easy_install between them have 17,000+ questions on StackOverflow!  </p>
<p>The typical <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows">easy_install / pip route</a> is tolerable, more or less, if you're coder, and you live in a *nixy everybody-is-a-coder and everybody-has-a-compiler environment. When you're busy experimenting with different frameworks and shiny new toys that show up on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">the cheeseshop</a>, it's great to get all that cool free stuff with just a a few keystrokes.  But this is "easy" only in the sense that hand editing config files to set up a web server is "easy": if you're technically confident, willing to debug anomalies, and have enough background knowledge to sort of the hiccups you'll be fine. But that's not "easy" for 99% of humanity, that's easy for hardcore nerds.   </p>
<p>The Python distribution ecosystem just isn't... well... Pythonic.  It embarrassingly fails the <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">pythonic principle</a>  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
</pre></div>


<p>since there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076/differences-between-distribute-distutils-setuptools-and-distutils2">at least 4 big toolsets</a> (setuptoools, distutils, distribute and distribute 2) and none of them is perfect. All rely on a mixture of static data and scripts that react to the state of your local machine, so installing stuff can provide different results from different orders of operation or different environment settings.  It also fails both  </p>

</pre></div>


<p>and     </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    Complex is better than complicated.
</pre></div>


<p>Since the operations you need to perform are often obscure and obscurely interdependent.  Even on a mac, which (being *nixy) should be a much friendlier environment for the live-install approach, I've had serious nightmares -- <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2013/12/and-i-thought-we-had-it-bad.html">trying to set up Django was like a &amp;!*^#&amp;^$ Kafka novel.</a>  To some degree my bad luck there reflects failure to live up to  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
</pre></div>


<p>because many of the problems come from a welter of competing installation scripts and tools that are constantly trying to make things "easy" for one application in ways that make them harder for others.  </p>
<p>To be fair, the Python universe is so diverse that it's almost beyond the possibility of rational management : a big product like <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-4.2-to-4.3/updating-package-dependencies">Plone </a>can involve literally hundreds of dependencies including a mix of python and compiled code that has to run on dozens of platforms.  Even if 99% of them install flawlessly, the remainders still add up to (at best ) a long, frustrating afternoon of  head-scratching, doc-reading forensics.  It's DLL hell all over again.  </p>
<p>It's enough to make you long for a blankety-blank InstallShield wizard.   </p>
<p>On the receiving end, things are just as confusing and intimidating.  Because Python is so multi-platform, lots of packages expect you to be able to compile your own binaries, which is rarely a trivial undertaking even for coders (at least, for people who don't do much non-python programming) and is petrifying for end users. More dangerous, though, is the fact that not everybody does a great job of tracking their own dependencies or knowing their own requirements.  If package X will works with version 2.1 of package Y, but not with 2.2  upgrading Y to 2.35 will break X.  And  of course Y 2.35 might have come along after the author of package X has moved on to other projects.  And Y 2.2 may be required by package Z, and get upgraded automatically when you grab Z to check it out.  </p>
<p>All of this puts us in the rotten position where installing something new has the potential to break existing code. The user is the one who has to figure that out and work around it, and the fix is often "you can't do this and that in the same install unless you write a patch yourself."   </p>
<p><a href="https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/1.0.1/">pip</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076/differences-between-distribute-distutils-setuptools-and-distutils2">buildout</a> do a heroic job of trying to organize all this chaos. However the underlying problem is _extremely _hard, because the foundations are shaky. You've got decades' worth of code, full of shadowy, hard-to-track dependencies, made by hundreds of different hands with widely varying levels of care and forethought.  The  requirements for packages may not even be clear to their authors: do you know every nuance of the version differences in the packages you rely on? Do you always know when you're exploiting a behavior that the developers don't like and want to change?   </p>
<p>Hell, I cannot honestly say that for my <em>own</em> code all the time.  </p>
<p>The short version of all this: being able to install stuff is not the same as maintaining a healthy environment.  Just ask all your older relatives whose machines sport seventeen different internet toolbars.  </p>
<h2>Habitat Crisis!</h2>
<p>If that all sounds bad... well, in the technical art / Maya context, it's <em>worse</em>.  For a couple of reasons:  </p>
<p><a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/habitat_for_two_manatees_bumper_sticker-r4dabf424d562476183df7d3644afd8f8_v9wht_8byvr_512.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/habitat_for_two_manatees_bumper_sticker-r4dabf424d562476183df7d3644afd8f8_v9wht_8byvr_512.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First, and most importantly, artist users are aren't going to accept a "real" command-line-and-text-file based system on their own, even if we had one. That means the TAs have to do it ~~automagically~~ remotely, which is a non-trivial tech challenge.  All too often 'remote installation' translates to 'send some poor sucker running around typing stuff for the artists while they everybody stands around waiting to get back to work.'   And wait till the next big update happens when somebody's on vacation; suddenly they're out of sync with the rest of the team and generating weird issues that are hard to debug. A first class ticket to 'It works on my machine' land!  </p>
<p>All tech support is made more difficult by a diversity of environments: that's why console games are easier to make than PC games even though the underlying tech is the same.  Asking your artists to maintain their own Python ecosystem is like asking your teenage kids to clean their rooms: if they do it at all, it won't be done that well enough to justify the arguing you need to get it done at all. It's hard enough to get a big art team to stay in sync with simple stuff like 'always get latest in perforce' or 'set this environment variable'.   So... managing a complex programming environment?  </p>
<p>In a shell window?  </p>
<p><em>Seriously?</em>  </p>
<p>To some degree this is a moot point: no matter your preferences, you might not have the kind of access you need to use python's admin level tools anyway.  If you have to work with outsourcers, as I do,  you don't have the option of ~~forcing your users at gunpoint~~ empowering your users to manage their own setups. In a lot of places (China especially) you can't count on the end user having admin privileges (thus, no writing into the Maya directory) or always-on internet access (thus, no pip/easy_install).   </p>
<p>Even if you have the rights, it might not be a good idea.  Outsource teams don't like having to reconfigure their whole workspace to accommodate a client who is here today and gone tomorrow. They want a clean, disposable, drop-in setup that they can turn on and off quickly.  A nice discrete footprint removes a lot of hassle from the relationship.  Done properly, it also saves a lot of remote support time and money.  Simplicity pays.  </p>
<p>That's true even for pure in-house development: any company that supports multiple teams needs the same flexibility to swap out toolsets easily without going deep into machine- or user-level configuration. At work I have people hopping between two or three distinct toolsets during an ordinary day, and it's vital that they can do this without wasting time or thought on how things like setting setting all sorts of environment variables or remembering to launch Maya from the right command line.  </p>
<h2>Save the Endangered Pythons!</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/blog/uploads/zombie.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://www.kingsnake.com/blog/uploads/zombie.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>All this adds up to a some pretty stark requirements for Maya python tools:  </p>
<ol>
<li>You want a Python environment that's uniform for all your users</li>
<li>You want to be able to have more than one environment side by side</li>
<li>You want your environments to be easy to distribute - and easy to delete </li>
</ol>
<p>In the wider Python world, this would automatically make you think <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a><em>.</em>  </p>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> is the most popular solution to the messy round-robin of versioning, dependency management, and distribution.  While it's all sorts of sophisticated under the hood (here's some <a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-reverse-engineering-ian-bicking-s-brain-inside-pip-and-virtualenv-4899496">details here</a>) it's conceptually very simple: cut all the crap and just make a separate Python for every project, containing exactly what we need!  Throw in <a href="http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/">pip </a>- the best-of-a-bad-lot installer tool that makes installing new modules as good as it's likely to get - and you can quickly create and populate lots of clean environments and populate them. Or use <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout </a>to create precisely controlled setups that have exactly what you need this time.  It's brilliant, Gordian-knot-cutting solution that replaces the incredible complexity of package management tools --  albeit at the cost of lots of duplicated code on disk. Disk space, however, is far cheaper than debugging time and tech-support hand holding.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've never been able to figure out how to get a running Maya to use a virtualenv at runtime. The Maya application appears to be it's own python interpreter (you can verify this by checking _sys.executable _in your command window, or just by renaming mayapy.exe and noting that Maya still works fine).  Which means that virtualenv's main trick -- recursing up from the physical location of the python executable -- isn't going to work correctly.  We don't want to try copying Maya itself and all of it's zillions of dependencies  -- a hefty half-gigabyte or so --for every new project.  And even if we do, the licensing engine does actually care if you're running from the default install directory (at least, it's never let me get away with copying maya to a new location even on a licensed machine).  </p>
<p>Effectively, Maya already <em>is</em> it's own virtualenv . That's why you can have other versions of Maya running independently of other Pythons installed on your machine.  Which is nice and all  -- but no help for the problem of creating a cleanly isolated toolsets for your Maya users.  </p>

<p>After banging my head against this for a while - I'm <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16678334/virtualenv-and-maya">not the only one who's tried it</a> - I've switched to a tactic that has most of the same properties as the virtualenv but is more Maya-friendly.  I try to replicate the same level of isolation with a rather higher level of uniformity (OK, let's be honest here: I mean <em>fascistic control</em>) over what my users get.  </p>
<p>While I'm not convinced its the distribution system to end all systems, I'm fairly happy with it - it's definitely been the least troublesome, lowest maintenance setup I've administered over the years, and it's worked pretty reliably for me both in and out of house.  I'll describe it a soon-to-be-completed followup post.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, allow me to say that looking at lots of bumper stickers while seeking funny graphics for your blog is a speedy way to dim your faith in humanity. <em>Not recommended.</em>  </p>
