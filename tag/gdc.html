                <p>It doesn’t take much super-secret industry-insider special knowledge to know that the big story this year was VR, VR and more VR – if the you had somehow managed to miss out on the pre-show hype the giant black Oculus booth looming like the Death Star right over the entrance to the expo floor told pretty much the whole story in one glance.   </p>
<p><a href="https://gdc.tech.ubm.com/eventAssets/gameev_2016_151009160527/image/gdc16_logo-color.png"><img alt="" src="https://gdc.tech.ubm.com/eventAssets/gameev_2016_151009160527/image/gdc16_logo-color.png" /></a></p>
<p>It is, however, interesting to note how cynical we’ve become as an industry about tech bubbles: from MMOs to Facebook games to In-app purchases and 3-D TVs, we’ve all lived through so many Next Big Things that we habitually reserve judgement – even on things like the latest crop of VR gear which sets our little nerdly hearts a-fluttering. I had a lot of conversations with people on the general theme of <em>“wow, that’s cool. In three years most of them will be out of business, though.”</em> – even with people in the VR business itself.   </p>
<p>Personally, I think VR is going to survive but I don’t think it’ll be the kind of world-changing, ubiquitous tech that the broadband internet and handhelds have turned out to be. It’s an awesome geek toy and the gateway to many interesting and novel experiences. I see it sort of like that kayak in the garage: a cool thing that gets dusted off a few times a year but not a regular part of daily life, and never going to buffed up to the high consumerist gloss of an iPhone. Maybe in another decade, but for now it’s a really cool niche product. I hope all that crazy money sloshing around in VR land fuels some general purpose innovation : in particular, I hope that VR’s need for screaming framerates in two renders at once may make hardware that is more performant overall and also for split-screen friendly deferred rendering.</p>
<p>In the actual, as opposed to the virtual, world the highlight of the show for me is always the TA roundtables. It’s such a great resource for the community, and a chance for folks who often live a bit outside the main stream of their development teams to get together with people who share their unique and esoteric pain. Those three roundtables are the only room full of people who will chuckle at jokes about MaxScript and who truly appreciate the hopeless pathos of sending emails about proper check-in procedures to a team of artists. As always, hats off to <a href="https://plus.google.com/116461271591099938175">+Jeff Hanna</a>  for running the roundtables and also the TA Bootcamp, which I had to miss this year but sounded really good. I’m anxiously awaiting the release of the talks I missed on the <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art">GDC Vault</a>.  </p>
<p>In these annual roundups I usually try to note the size and intensity of the job market. This year was kind of difficult to gauge. The big mega-booths from mega-teams were largely absent this year: I didn’t see many of the long lines of students queuing up to show their portfolios to Blizzard, Bungie, or 343. On the other hand the general commercial tempo seemed pretty up beat. I think this reflects the general trend away from big, highly institutionalized teams and toward smaller, more agile (but also more fragile) groupings: the job market is more fragmented but not necessarily smaller than in years gone by. I could be wrong about that one, though – this might just be a mid-console-cycle lull.  </p>
<p>To all the folks I saw down at the show – it was awesome! To those who didn’t make it this year – don’t miss it next time!  </p>
<p>PS - one important thing that came out of the round table is that more and more people are signing up to the <a href="http://tech-artists.org/forum/showthread.php?5748-Tech-Artists-Org-is-now-on-Slack!">Tech artists slack channel</a>.

                <p>I noticed that my 2015 GDC talk, <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art">Technical Art For Art Directors</a>,  is currently up on the GDC Vault and is not behind the paywall.

                <p>It's time again for GDC speakers to submit their proposals.  TA's have a long history of providing excellent talks at the main conference and at the Tech Art Bootcamp - so take some time to put together a proposal for this year's conference.   </p>
<p>For more on why this is a Good Idea<sup>tm</sup>, check out <a href="submit.html">last year's post on the same topic</a>.  One important note! This year the call for subs closes on August 27, <strong>NOT</strong> August 28 as it is in the linked post !</p>

                <p>I see that the slides from my 2015 GDC talk, <em>Technical Art For Art Directors</em> is now up on the <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art">GDC Vault</a>. <strong>paywall warning</strong> Enjoy – and feedback in the comments is very welcome. I can post the slides if there is interest, but if you watch the video you’ll see that they don’t really work without the verbal context. I defy anybody who wasn't there to make sense of this image, for example....  </p>

<p>I’ll say in passing that – despite the lack of text in the finished presentation – I had great luck putting this talk together in <a href="markdown_wrapup.html">Markdown</a> using <a href="http://www.decksetapp.com/">DeckSet</a>, which let me do the first 90% of the presentation without ever opening PowerPoint or Keynote. The slides were just one big plain text file, which let me <a href="https://github.com/theodox/tadwtf/blob/master/tadwtf_slides.md">put them up on github</a> so I could version them and track changes without getting bogged down in the finicky formatting nonsense that ultimately consumes all slide decks. I particularly liked this workflow because I could work as if it was text but still run it as a slide show very early on, which gave me a chance to get my patter down and listen to the words instead of getting hung up on formatting text. <strong>Plain text FTW!</strong></p>

                <p>I'm working a talk for <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a> , tentatively entitled "<em>Technical</em> Art Director? What the heck does that mean?"  </p>
<p>I'd love to hear thoughts from all you industry types on what the role means. That could be what you think it means for your company, or what you think it means when other people hear it, or what you think it ought to mean. </p>
<p>Good anecdotes are particularly appreciated and may be shamelessly stolen :)</p>
<p>So please comment below and let me know what you think while I'm trying to figure out what I think...  </p>

                <p>Well, another year, another <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a>.  </p>
<p>An upbeat show - the combination of the indie/mobile tidal wave and a new console generation has breathed some much needed life into the old beast - the business center was bigger than I've seen it in years, and full of people hustling.  </p>
<h2><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FbM1i70bco8/Uy51CRDoDiI/AAAAAAABIBY/8_SGnjlJxeM/s1600/GDC.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FbM1i70bco8/Uy51CRDoDiI/AAAAAAABIBY/8_SGnjlJxeM/s1600/GDC.jpg" /></a></h2>
<p>The floor was buzzing!  </p>
<p>The absence of many familiar AAA names was still pretty striking - no lines around the block for the Activision/EA meat markets, no scores of kids waiting to show their portfolios to someone from Blizzard or whatnot.  </p>
<p>There was, however, a booth from <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>. Someboedy told me they are <em>hiring tech artists</em>.  See, we're conquering the world... from above!  </p>
<p>And, there was an amazing bustle of activity from the indie-casual-mobile side. Tons and tons of booths, more than I remember ever seeing before. Most of them will probably be gone in two years, but it's still great to see people hustling around, coming up with plans, and trying to make something big after all the gloom of the last few years.  Here's hoping the many friends and former colleagues who've been battered by business can make up some lost ground in this new gold rush.  It's probably another bubble - remember when everybody wanted to hire a teal of 800 to talk on WOW? - but it's still better than sitting around moping.   </p>
<p>All the movement has a lot to do with all the changes in the business that have broken the stifling rut of AAA juggernauts, sequel-itis, and me-too design that was hanging over us like a fog a few years back. All sorts of fun and interesting stuff happening.   </p>
<p>Saw some cool tech too, which I'll talk about later in the week. In the meantime: so long SF!  </p>
<p>Update: I did not see this talk, but <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GregCostikyan/20140324/213784/2014_GDC_Rant_We_Had_a_Good_10_Years_But_the_Walls_are_Closing_In.php">this rant from Greg Costikyan</a> does summarize neatly some things I am worrying about over the long haul...  </p>
