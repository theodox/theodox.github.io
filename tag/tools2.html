<p>3DCoat is an interesting voxel-based alternative to Zbrush. It deserves a lot of credit for really pushing the retopology business forward, and also for early PTex support. The interface is less idiosyncratic than Zbrush's but less by-the-numbers than Mudbox.  </p>

                    New tools watch: MARI
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Lately - particularly since the demise of the <a href="sigh.html">late, lamented XSI</a>, I've been increasingly worried about getting too locked in to any one vendor for my tools.  I go way back with Photoshop - I once emailed a bug report directly to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knoll">John Knoll</a> on my <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/07/goodbye-compuserve-we-thought-you-had-already-died/">Compuserve </a>(!!) account.  I was in the audience for the Maya launch at SIGGRAPH in, I think it was 1997.   </p>
<p>Jeez, I'm really fricking <em>old.</em> But I digress.  </p>
<p>The point is, I love those tools. They've been part of my life for a long time. But I don't like being too beholden to anybody, especially not an anybody who's a big public company that has to answer to shareholders and analysts and is not particularly worried about competition.  </p>
<p>For that reason I'm actively looking for alternatives to supplement or even supplant the old standbys.  And this GDC gave me some up-close and personal time with a very promising one: <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/mari/">Mari</a>, the 3-d painting app from <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/">the Foundry</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgsociety.org/stories/2010_05/mari/banner01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.cgsociety.org/stories/2010_05/mari/banner01.jpg" /></a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of Mari work on <em>Avatar</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>More after the jump.  </p>
<p>Caveat: this is <em>not</em> a real review; it's a quick rundown of what I learned from a demo and some conversations with the devs.  If I write a real review, I'll mark it as such. This is more of a scouting report.  </p>
<p>Mari is a 3d paint package.  A very cool one.  </p>
<p>There have been 3d paint packages for a long time, since the SGI days, but they've never been a highly competitive area outside of the film business. The best software used to be confined to high-end workstations.  The most popular PC 3d painter, <a href="http://www.maxon.net/products/new-in-cinema-4d-r15/overview.html">Body Paint</a>, has never become a mainstream tool (at least in the US), perhaps since it's most closely aligned with <a href="http://www.maxon.net/products/cinema-4d-prime/who-should-use-it.html">Cinema4D</a>, which remains an outsider choice over here.  Although it does a pretty good job, it hasn't gotten a huge fan base -- it may be that the overlap with the free, built-in <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/global/docs/maya2014/en_us/index.html?url=files/3D_Paint_Tool_Paint_Textures_on_3D_objects.htm,topicNumber=d30e383981">PaintFX/Artisan</a> tools in Maya kept it from gaining a lot of momentum.  PaintFX itself is -- well, it's free, it works OK if you have basic needs and good UVs, and I don't know a lot of folks who rely on it for much more than basic masks or blocking in broad strokes to be filled out in Photoshop.  The lack of layering, oddball texture handling, and finicky paint projection have all made it a feel like an afterthought: the MS paint of 3d paintng. Sure, it works... but, you know...  </p>
<p>So against this background I was a little skeptical when I went for my demo. I've run trial versions of Mari before, and the older version I have played with suffered from a somewhat idiosyncratic interface.  Mari originated at WETA Digital as an in-house tool and its roots in a very particular pipeline used to be very apparent.  The newest version (I believe I was shown 2.6, the website touts 2.5 as the latest) has a much more comprehensible feel.  </p>
<p>Like BodyPaint, but unlike PaintFX/Artisan, Mari supports layers. However it takes the concept of layering and runs with it way past where, say, Photoshop has to stop and catch it's breath.  Its has more in common with a node-graph based compositing tool (say, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-flame-family/features/flame-premium-products/all/gallery-view">Flame </a>or <a href="https://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke-product-family/nuke/features/">Nuke</a>)  than a joe-blow paint layer system. You can re-route channels from one map to another non-destructively. For example you could use a crisped up, high-contrast version of your diffuse texture as a spec mask - and be able to flow changes forward from the diffuse texture as you kept woirking while also adding new detail on top of the spec channel : each map gets its own stack of layers. Here's a video from the 2.0 version which touches on the concept:  </p>
<p>You can even put layers <em>on your layer masks</em>, which is extremely powerful and should be picked up by everybody else in painting soon. Plus you can make procedural layers (which can themselves be layer masks...). Even without the 3-d ness this would be a pretty compelling painting technology. Combined with the ability to paint specular or ambient occlusion masks directly in real time, its extra cool. Add in a nifty filter that lets you paint onto normal maps (again, real-time) while keeping your normals normalized and it's really, really cool.  </p>
<p>The 3D painting itself looked really smooth, with a good brush engine and pretty impressive performance (the demo was running on a Macbook Retina 15 laptop, so a very good but not firebreathing machine).  The most surprising bit was the resolutions that were possible: painting on multiple 4-k textures at once did not seem to faze the program (caveat: it's a demo. I'd assume they are pretty careful to pick subject matter that makes them look good).   </p>
<p>The extra high resolution is handy because the program also does a really nice job transferring textures to meshes with different UVs. Evidently they do it using a very dense color point cloud, rather than the more common raycast solutions that you see in, eg, Maya's transfer maps toolset.  The results looked pretty good even on pretty crummy auto-generated UV sets; this makes it easy to imagine painting big textures on high res models and transferring them to game-res as a final step, instead of committing to the low-res model and textures early on -- a workflow I've been championing for a long time.  </p>
<p>The last big plus for me was a built-in Python interpreter (looked like a 2.6 series). This should make it a much better citizen of the pipeline than some other painting programs I could mention, which require you to <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/01/talking-to-photoshop-via-tcp.html">reinvent network communications</a> if you want to get anything done script-wise.  </p>
<p>Other good things:<br />
<em> <a href="http://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/743-Creating-Ptex-Textures-in-MARI">Support for PTex, the no-uv texturing system</a>. I'm not clear, though, on how to convert a PTex painted object to UVs.<br />
</em> Linear color workflow<br />
<em> A nice image-based lighting / physically based renderer preview (think <a href="http://www.marmoset.co/">SkyShop or Toolbag</a>)<br />
</em> Programmable shaders for the viewport, so you could paint directly into your game shaders  </p>
<p>All in all, this was a great first impression. As I said, it was a demo not a hands on, so I'm reporting what I saw which I expect was chosen well. However I'll write more when I've had a chance to grab a demo and actually use it myself.

                    Sliders!
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Although GDMag is no more, I still occasionally get interesting press releases from PR flacks who haven't gotten the bad news. This morning,  one from <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/">MakeHuman</a> caught my eye.  </p>
<h2><a href="http://www.makehuman.org/sites/makehuman.org/files/images/3/img003_001.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.makehuman.org/sites/makehuman.org/files/images/3/img003_001.png" /></a></h2>
<p>Now with realistic back flab!  </p>
<p>MakeHuman is a new open sourced parametric modeling / body morphing program written in Python.  The overall use case is similar to <a href="http://poser.smithmicro.com/gallery.html">Poser</a> or <a href="http://www.daz3d.com/">Daz3d</a>.  It seems like it also incorporates some of the underlying ideas from the venerable <a href="http://www.facegen.com/">FaceGen</a> - particularly having a few high level sliders that correlate changes across many different aspects of a model. </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MDesUhTFBYM/UyXbys3vv1I/AAAAAAABH9o/PEIhdil6obE/s1600/makeh.png"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MDesUhTFBYM/UyXbys3vv1I/AAAAAAABH9o/PEIhdil6obE/s1600/makeh.png" /></a></p>
<h3>Prognathism += .05</h3>
<p>The slider set that comes with MakeHuman is pretty good. I didn't do a count but I'd guess there are several hundred.  Unlike many similar programs you can get a decent variety of body types outside the Burne Hogarth / superhero range, with decent control over the high level feel of the model. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OcSmU55zGkk/UyXt2tCPLvI/AAAAAAABH-Q/OQ70pbYgcwc/s1600/bodytypes.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OcSmU55zGkk/UyXt2tCPLvI/AAAAAAABH-Q/OQ70pbYgcwc/s1600/bodytypes.png" /></a></p>
<p>The high frequency details that you really wouild need to sell the model are still up to you, however - fat rolls, wrinkles, scars and so on are going to have to be painted on or hand modelled in a later step.</p>
<p>Like most slider-modeler programs it's easy to create really disturbing imagery, but the underlying slider set is pretty good, with a decent amount of anatomically based sliders for facial and body proportions.  Like all slider-modellers it suffers from the tension between local control and overall believability - it's easy to start noodling on a detail only to discover you've undermined the whole product.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-um2YWid2fNk/UyXm310LhaI/AAAAAAABH94/bmzSUhs80SY/s1600/lotsasliders.png"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-um2YWid2fNk/UyXm310LhaI/AAAAAAABH94/bmzSUhs80SY/s1600/lotsasliders.png" /></a></p>
<p>As always with these kinds of things , you are teleported right to the bottom of the <a href="http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/EGDFall08/postmortemreadings/Theodore%20Uncanny%20Valley.pdf">Uncanny Valley</a> when you first start to twiddle things; the vacant stare can really get to you as you creep those sliders along (I will not speculate on which sliders <em>you _spend the most time creeping, but if you've looked at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=poser+models&amp;safe=active&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vt8lU7LwGoqDogS7q4CgBA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1180&amp;bih=974">Poser (NSFW) </a>I bet you can guess which one gets the most over-use. Makes you think:: _What a missed microtransaction opportunity!</em>).   </p>
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>If you go into any slider-modeller expecting shippable characters with strong personalities to pop out the other end, you'll be disappointed.  That's not where these tools shine.  </p>
<p>One-button art is not really the point with these kinds of tools.  They are, however,  a fabulous way to kick off a ZBrush sculpt or play with ideas quickly.  The topology  on the base meshes that come with the package seems pretty good to me, although I'm sure plenty of artists will have their own preferences. However MakeHuman  allows you to provide alternate base meshes (another trick pioneered by FaceGen back in the day) so you could provide your own body meshes before hitting the sliders if you so desire.   </p>
<h2><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ju73PA4gS8/UyXnRjYcyII/AAAAAAABH-A/maJd8o1mGy0/s1600/hai.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ju73PA4gS8/UyXnRjYcyII/AAAAAAABH-A/maJd8o1mGy0/s1600/hai.png" /></a></h2>
<p>The base topo and skinning aren't bad  </p>
<p>The program can also output ready-riigged characters witth a variety of skeletons to FBX and other intermediate formats.  As with the models, go in expecting to have to tweak the results - but again, its a huge accelerator for progress. The selection of hair, clothing and accessories is pretty small compared to what you'd get with the commercial alternatives, but adding your own is not too tough (an <a href="http://www.aversionofreality.com/blog/2014/1/30/project-maiko-creating-the-base-bodysuit">example tutorial here</a>)  </p>
<p>For TA's one of the most interesting aspects of the program is the fact that it's mostly written in Python, and that the source code is freely available. If you're interested in adding your own sliders, or new deformation algorithms, or more body data the way is open.  One thing that I'd liove to see more of in the program is a mode based on real world body scan data - one of the ways FaceGen was ahead of its time was its use of statistical models rather than the more obvious 'make bigger butt cheeks' sliders, which meant that randomly generated characters usually started from a more plausible place than the familiar monstrosities of, say, Oblivion:  </p>

                <p>It's bad enough we just lost <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/movies/harold-ramis-who-helped-redefine-what-makes-us-laugh-on-screen-dies-at-69.html?_r=0">Harold Ramis</a>.  </p>
<p>Now we've also lost <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-softimage/overview">SoftImage</a>.   </p>
<p>Although I've never used XSI professionally, I was incredibly impressed by the people who made it, and I've always felt that XSI was a superior product to Max or Maya: making better use of modern hardware and showing off really innovative concepts in an industry that's gotten pretty damn stale for something that's sounds so high tech and is occasionally so magical.  </p>
<p>In honor of the passing of this great piece of software, I'm going to reprint an article I wrote for <em><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/topic/game-developer">Game Developer</a></em> back in 2008 when the sale of XSI to Autodesk was first announced.  I'm afraid I may have been a little too optimistic. However I do think that the basic idea of the piece - that we let ourselves in for this kind of treatment by not being more informed and flexible consumers - is still true.   </p>
<p>In the mean time, I'm going to go have an Irish wake for a poor old XSI.  (BTW, if you're waiting on the follow-up to <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/02/rescuing-maya-gui-from-itself.html">Rescuing Maya GUI From Itself, </a>I'm cleaning up the code and writing tests before I go blabbing...)  </p>

<p>If you’ve been in a crunch-time media blackout for the past month, or shut down your internet connection to avoid election news,  or are the only games artist on the planet who’s never received a youtube link via email you may have missed an interesting little tidbit of news. On October 23 we learned that Avid is going to sell SoftImage, the Montreal-based developer or SoftImage|XSI to Autodesk.  If and when the deal goes through, all three of the biggest 3d modeling and animation packages will all belong to a single company.  </p>
<p>Even if you managed to miss the announcement, you can probably predict the immediate reactions anyway.   In the XSI community, the dominant mode was shell-shock.  The “Resistance is Futile” jokes and Borg-themed Photoshop jobs could not disguise the level of emotion in the air -- the poster on the XSI forums who simply said “I think I’ll cry” wasn’t kidding.  There was a smattering of optimists suggesting the deal would give more people access to some of XSI’s best tech.  A few pragmatists found consolation in the idea that the conglomeration would give cross-package data transfer the attention it deserves.  But the most common reactions were shock and anxiety.    </p>
<p>It’s hardly surprising that the possibility of being forced to abandon the comfort and security of a familiar environment would give XSI users the heebie-jeebies.  The official Pixel Pusher line has always been that any professional game artist should be competent in at least two packages. But even traditional artists are famous for being emotionally attached to their tools (never, ever venture an opinion about Kolinsky sable brushes in mixed company!) For us, who spend so much of our lives poking at one particular set of dialogs or buttons, the thought of being forced to swap them for a different, unfamiliar set of dialogs and buttons is deeply disturbing.  The fact that some XSI fans were so distraught they’d consider switching to Blender out of pique is an index of how emotional this issue can be.  </p>
<p>What’s surprising, though, is that a similar miasma could be seen in the Max and Maya forums after the buyout announcement. Emotions ran high even for those not affected directly. Hardcore Maya fans suffered flashbacks as they relived the 2006 buyout of Alias.  More commonly, though, users were grimly pondering the future of graphics software in general, rather than the fate of any particular package.  Some naysayers worried that technology would stagnate without the underdogs like XSI striving to gain an advantage through innovation. Others fretted that consolidation in the industry means the exciting, Wild-West days of graphics are really over.  And many users of all three packages speculated that the lack of competition will lead to price gouging.</p>

<p>Before we pronounce the graphics software business dead, we ought to look at this deal in its historical context.  These kinds of corporate dramas are unsettling for artists because they are an unsubtle reminder that we creative types are dependent on huge, impersonal corporations to get anything done. Masters-of-the-Universe style MBA analysis isn’t part of our job descriptions, so it’s hard for use mere users to figure out how to respond. A little bit of history, however, is often a good way to get some perspective; so here’s a very abbreviated walk through the life and times of SoftImage to help you understand today’s news.</p>
<p>XSI may be the youngest of the big three graphics packages, but SoftImage the company is one of the oldest firms in 3d graphics software.  The original “SoftImage Creative Environment” debuted in 1988, but in an economic environment very different from todays.  3D graphics was very closely akin to rocket science – for one thing, it was mysterious new high-tech discipline and for another you needed an exotic workstation that cost upwards of $50,000<a href="file:///E:/Users/Stephen%20Theodore/Documents/My%20Dropbox/Dropbox/Columns/2008/1108/1108%20-%20M%20Word.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> to do either one.  It was a very esoteric, very pricey business.  </p>
<p>SoftImage|3D  was the first commercial application to offer artist-friendly IK (1991) and it quickly became the gold standard for computer animation.  Many seminal CGI films of the early ‘90’s were animated in SoftImage, most famously <strong>Jurassic Park.  </strong>Those early days of the CG revolution were heady times. Hollywood stood ready to firehose money onto anybody who could render a good looking triangle  -- SIGGRAPH veterans still murmur nostalgically about the heydays of studio parties – and the boom times were good for the company. In 1992, the Montreal firm went public to much acclaim. ****</p>
<p>Success also changed the way the industry worked.   By the mid ‘90s, the explosion of 3d game development shifted the industry dynamic: the ranks of 3d artists and animators expanded enormously, but few games companies could afford to put the equivalent of a luxury sports car under every animator’s desk.  Affordable PCs with primitive graphics cards started stealing business from workstations and PC based packages like Autodesk’s 3d Studio started making inroads against pricey workstation software.  </p>
<h2><em>From Sale Of Stock You Get $45</em></h2>
<p><a href="http://adena.com/adena/mo/ccstock.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://adena.com/adena/mo/ccstock.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, wanted to see the PC forces prevail . In 1994 they bought SoftImage for $130 million – a pretty high price given that the whole 3D software market was only around $60 million a year back then. But box sales weren’t the real goal: Microsoft needed to port a top-end workstation graphics package to Windows and legitimize the market for high end graphics on Windows. </p>
<p>For many SoftImage vets, the events of last month may have an eerily familiar ring, right down to the “you will be assimilated” jokes (although,  in 1994 the reference was forgivably fresh).  </p>
<p>The MS acquisition was not a very pleasant experience for SoftImage users. Not only were many Unix devotees forcibly converted to a new OS, but the demands of porting and cross-platform development shunted innovation to the sidelines.  It took almost 7 years for SoftImage|3D to get from version 3.0 to version 4.0 , and the package lost a lot of its technological edge to newer platforms like 3dStudio Max and Maya.  It’s not surprising that the survivors of that first buyout react suspiciously to the latest.</p>
<p>By 1998, Microsoft had achieved its strategic objective: Windows had triumphed and graphics workstations were headed for the history books.  SoftImage became superfluous.  Microsoft sought out a buyer and found Avid, a rising power in the digital video editing business which coveted the company’s VFX and compositing tech.  Even if the core 3d business was losing steam, the deal still ran a cool $285 million – a price that might have been inflated by internet bubble, but it’s still pretty impressive.  </p>
<p>Avid’s stewardship was a lot healthier for SoftImage as a tech company. SoftImage XSI, the long overdue gut-rehab of the aging SoftImage|3D, was released in 2000.  The product started out a bit slow – version 1.0 had no poly modeling tools! – but gained steam with impressive tech and clean new architecture. Many artists have lusted after XSI’s GATOR system for mapping one mesh onto another (supporting everything from texture transfers to skin weight matching) , its non-linear animation mixer, Face Robot facial animation technology, and most recently the high-perfomance ICE system for node-based custom object creation.    </p>
<h2><em>Second Prize in a Beauty Contest, Collect $11</em></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the eningeering success of the product did not translate into success for SoftImage’s owners.  Avid’s core business has been hit hard by the proliferation of lower-cost video editing software like Apple’s Final Cut Pro.  Even though the SoftImage was profitable, it wasn’t profitable enough: to get a sense of the scale, you might note that the $35 million sale price for the company won’t even cover Avid’s losses for the 3rdquarter of this year.  As times got leaner, Avid needed to focus on protecting its core video editing business, so it started hunting for a buyer early this year.  Autodesk, as home to both of XSI’s a main rivals, was not the first buyer who was approached… but it was the final one, which is the one that counts.  </p>
<p>What lessons can you learn from this little history?   </p>
<p>First, it doesn’t provide a lot of evidence for conspiracy theories about monopoly power.  The fact is, supplying 3d software is pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of capitalism.  It’s been said that there are only about half a million seats of full 3d packages in the world – sounds like a lot, but that’s smaller than the number of people in the <em>beta program</em> alone for Photoshop.  It’s not a market where achieving dominance is a huge financial win.  All three turnovers at SofImage  have been driven by strategic concerns that didn’t have to do with monopoly power or market domination.  Microsoft bought SoftImage to catalyze the switch from workstations to PCs. Avid bought it to solidify its FX and compositing business and saw modeling and animation through that prism.  The most recent sale didn’t originate with a sinister plot from inside of Autodesk, it originated with Avid’s accountants.    </p>
<p>The more interesting – but also more depressing – aspect of this story, though, isn’t concerned with money. You could read the whole thing as a stirring tale of steadfast devotion. It was user loyalty that sustained SoftImage during the drift of the Microsoft years, when technical sluggishness might have let Max and Maya completely marginalize the original SoftImage.  The emotional reaction to the news is proof of how viscerally loyal users are to their favorite tools.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that loyalty is a two edged sword.  The last few version of XSI were consistently excellent -- but no combination of cool features and good design managed to seduce away enough users from other packages to secure SoftImage’s future.  They competed on tech and features and did a great job – but it wasn’t enough to overcome the entrenched loyalties of Max and Maya fans. Individual artists might admire this feature or that bit of UI, but collectively we’re reactionaries: we stick with what we know. On top of that, most studios have tools and processes are designed around a particular package and aren’t eager to chuck those investments for the sake of sexy icons or a cleaner interface.  </p>
<p>The fact is, we don’t really reward tools companies for pushing the envelope.  Even when something new does break into the scene, we try to shoehorn it into our existing workflows rather than embracing the new. We’re the last people to start denouncing monopolies and phoning up the Federal Trade Commission. Most of us have already folded our hands by letting ourselves become emotionally attached or technically beholden to particular bits of software.  If you’re in the same camp as the XSI user who posted “they’ll have to pry my license from my cold dead fingers,” you live in a virtual monopoly already.   </p>
<h2><em>Get Out Of Jail Free?</em></h2>
<p><a href="http://adena.com/adena/mo/chjail.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://adena.com/adena/mo/chjail.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That’s not to say that things aren’t going to change. The absence of major-league alternatives will definitely give Autodesk a much freer hand in choosing both its price points and research directions. T fact that their track record to date is pretty benign is comforting, but the knowledge that we’re dependent on their altruism from here on out should give us pause.  Autodesk has put some genuine effort into trying to explain the deal to users (there’s an interesting interview featuring the GMs of Autodesk and SoftImage up on the Autodesk website, with more info promised as the deal solidifies) but apart from reassurances that XSI isn’t going to go away overnight, the magic 8-ball is pretty cloudy.  </p>
<p>The uncertainty is tough, particularly for anxious XSI users but for all of us. We all know the mantra, “it’s the artist not the tools” – but in practice it’s sometimes hard to say where the artist leaves off and the tool begins. The feeling that such an important part of our lives is out of our control is unnerving. </p>
<p>What can we do about it? As individuals, that means being open to new software and new ways of working, so that we make an environment where companies have a real incentive to give us new and better tools. As studios we should invest in in-house tools rather than relying too faithfully on any single vendor.  As an industry we should push harder for more consistent, open standards in data formats and for open source tools so we can make our pipelines less dependent on the ups and downs of individual companies.  None of these steps will magically unwind the clock but they will give us a little more input into this critical part of our lives.   </p>
<p>Or, we could all switch to Blender… But man, I hate the way they do their menus. It’s not like Max. You couldn’t pay me enough to switch.  </p>

<p>I'm pleased and of course also nervous.  If you like it, please be sure to leave a positive review on Amazon - I'm told it makes a big difference.  I don't actually make any money from this one (such is modern publishing, alas) but I do have another book under way and it'll be much easier to get that published if this one does well and is well reviewed.   </p>

                    First find of 2014: A Scriptable DCC app in the browser?!?!
                </h2>
            </a>
                <p>Just stumbled across this link to <a href="http://clara.io/">clara.io</a>, which is an in-browser 3D editor from Ecocortex, one of the vendors behind the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/alembic/">Alembic file format</a>. It's a 3d modeler that runs in a browser.  And it's free.  </p>
<p>Sheesh.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YigSyxvbhNw/Usbzp7a29GI/AAAAAAAABYc/M06nOJapj_Q/s1600/claraio.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YigSyxvbhNw/Usbzp7a29GI/AAAAAAAABYc/M06nOJapj_Q/s1600/claraio.png" /></a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And look at the bottom - a script console!  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what to make of this, beyond <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acYDNlMYAaI"><em>totally wicked</em></a>.  I'm not going to try to review clara here - I just found it today, after all, but it's such an interesting find that I can't help but comment.  </p>
<p>The UI is a riff on familiar ideas, so it's easy to pick up for any TA, or for that matter anybody with more than a passing familiarity with the usual suspects. It doesn't break any new ground in productivity or ease of use - but that doesn't bother me in this context. Like the dog that walks on it's hind legs, it's not done perfectly but one is surprised to see it_ <em>done at all.  This is, after all running _in a browser.</em> Yikes.  </p>
<p>The app is still kind of wet behind the ears - it feels a trifle slow (some kinds of UI operations seem to trigger a perceptible refresh in all of the 3d views, for example). There are host of poly modeling tools -- notably booleans -- that Max/Maya users will miss pretty quickly.  All that said - the idea of running a zero-configuration, instantly deployable app from anywhere -- a tool you could be sure was the same for your outsources in Bangkok and on your own desktop <em>right now</em> -- along with inherent cloud data management?  The ability to run remote commands via web push commands, so you could set up a That is beyond just a curiosity. This app doesn't suddenly obsolete Max or Maya or XSI, but it might be the first rumblings of a big change in how things get done.  As a side benefit, it's got a several different file IO options and could perhaps make as decent waystation for people crossing product boundaries.  </p>
<p>The TA who immediately asks "what scripting language" will be pleased to note that there's a script console down at the bottom; unsurprisingly for a web app the scripting language is JavaScript.  JS may not be my favorite language -- not by a long shot! -- but it's the natural language of the web. Most importantly, the scripting system makes it fairly easy to extend the application by writing your own plugins: this example on their website shows <a href="http://clara.io/learn/sdk/creating-commands">how to make an OBJ importer</a>.   </p>
<p>Most important of all, though -- did I mention this? -- it's a browser app. Which means you can so things like this:   </p>
<iframe width="660" height="370" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0hrE8fSU08" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Which, you must admit, scores pretty well on the Gee-Whiz scale for a freakin browser app.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a really excellent developmnt. The 3d market has been painfully sluggish for a decade now - we've got better bells and whistles but on the whole we still work in 2014 more or less the away we worked in 2004.  We need new companies with fresh ideas to shake up this market.  We also need to <a href="and-i-thought-we-had-it-bad.html">embrace web development as a part of how we build tools</a>.  This is a big step in the right direction and we should do what we can to help it along.</p>
