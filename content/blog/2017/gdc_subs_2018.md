It's that time of year again: the [GDC call for submissions](http://www.gdconf.com/conference/c4p/index.html) is open. We're looking for artists, animators from tech artists of every stripe, shape, size and industry specialty to share their expertise and insights with the community.  This is a great opportunity to share knowledge and burnish up your professional credentials as well.

If you're interested in speaking you should also check out the  [discussion thread on TAO](http://tech-artists.org/t/gdc2018-tech-art-bootcamp-call-for-submissions/8953) about the tech artists' bootcamp, which has become a real pillar of the show over the last few years. Not only is it a great chance for first-time speakers to break in, it's an amazing opportunity to commune with the tech-art zeitgeist... and a great place to see what topics might make a good one-off talk for the general conference!
  
For more on why this is a Good Idea<sup>tm</sup>, check out [my perennial post on the same topic](/pages/pub/submit).   This year the call for subs closes on August 17, which is a bit earlier than last year. Don't dawdle!
