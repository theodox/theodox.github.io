Summary: The Character Rigger's Cookbook is back online.

A couple of months ago, Dropbox stopped serving image requests and the slides from the *Character Rigger's Cookbok* went offline.  

While scrambling around trying to figure out how to resurrect them, I discovered an old copy of the audio from the original talk. This allowed me to put together a YouTube of the whole thing (minus some of the animated examples, alas, which have long since disappeared).

I wish I had a proper presentation video so you could see my gyrations and gesticulations as I tried to illustrate things -- but, remembering how much hopping and posing I did for that talk, perhaps it's for the best.  The video + audio format here, even without accompanying animations, is way better than the bare slides were.  See, every cloud has a silver lining.  Phhhhttt, Dropbox!

If you want to permalink to the video you can use [this YouTube link](https://youtu.be/RlgLSq-GsVg) or link directly to the [Cookbook page](pages/cookbook) on my nav bar.
