I'm super excited to report that I can finally admit in public that [State of Decay 2](http://www.stateofdecay.com) is under development. Hats off to my team for an amazing job on the trailer (which, I hasten to add, is 100% in-engine using game assets... and which was put together in record time to boot).  

I was also kind of touched that the audience spontaneously applauded when they saw the Brontogas logo.  It's always cool to be reminded of _why_ we do what we do.

Here's the trailer if you missed the E3 presentations:

PS: One tech note that might be of interest to this audience: if you look really carefully in the interior scenes you might be able to see something that looks a lot like dynamic bounce lighting.  _Just sayin'..._
