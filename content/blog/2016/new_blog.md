Summary: ![](http://www.stageoflife.com/Portals/0/Blogging%20Resources/Blogging%20Cartoons/BloggingCartoon5.jpg)The new [Pelican](http://getpelican.com)-based blog is up! Please check it out and let me know how it's working!

After a [long pause](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2016/04/blogger-blues.html) I've finally completed the move to a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) based blog created with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). Converting old blogger files, a markdown based wiki, and a bunch of other random pages was quite and adventure, but it's more or less done now.  I'd appreciate it greatly if you let me know -- either via the comments or one of the social links that accompany each post -- if you find any bugs, dead links or missing images in the site so I can fix them up.

At some point I'll post an overview of how it went, but after several weekends of manually fixing old links, fiddling with CSS, and hitting 'refresh' on my browser I need to get up and walk around a bit.
