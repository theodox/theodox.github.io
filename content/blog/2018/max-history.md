I was doing a bit of googling relative to [this question on TAO](http://discourse.techart.online/t/history-of-python-in-cg/9863) and I found a two-part series on the history of 3ds Max, in the form of [this interview with Tom Hudson](http://cgpress.org/archives/cgarticles/the_history_of_3d_studio) and [this one with Gary Yost](http://cgpress.org/archives/cgarticles/the_history_of_3d_studio_pt2).  They make an interesting read.

It's really strange to read these stories of a young, scrappy and and almost underground Yost Group creating Max, instead of it being a part of the vast, gray expandse of the Autodesk-verse.  This quote is a bit telling:

>  **What is your current perception of the CG industry? How has the industry changed since you started developing 3D Studio, and what role do you think 3DS had in those changes?**

> Hmmm….  Consolidation.  When I started it was a highly fragmented industry with hundreds of different small software entrepreneurs developing lots of creative tools, healthily competing with one another.  Now of course the Big Three are all owned by Autodesk, and that’s certainly changed the competitive dynamic.  Also, when I began doing this many of these tools were very expensive… in the tens of thousands of dollars.  We began the trend of cost-reducing professional tools, but that got out of hand for awhile – sort of a commoditization of the market.  Customers started to expect an awful lot of functionality for a very low price… lower than the costs of actually developing this stuff.  And that put a lot of great engineers out of work.  Many have since moved on to other industries.  So there’s been a brain drain due to this low-cost price expectation and I feel partly responsible for that.  Those high prices in the old days weren’t sustainable though, and it was one of the reasons consolidation happened.  Perhaps this was all part of the process.  Who knows?

I distinctly remember that dynamic in the late 90's when those of us who had grown up on the cushy, somewhat lavish culture of $100,000 SGI workstations suddenly found ourselves competing with regular PCs running consumer graphics hardware and PC software like Max.  It was actually pretty wrenching: I recall one SIGGAPH panel where a presenter pitching the virtues of gamer-quality graphics cards on Windows NT was practically booed off stage by SGI fans in the audience.  

Of course, this cuts more ways than one.
