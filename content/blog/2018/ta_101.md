Summary: Some thoughts about building a coding culture for tech artists.

It's been long and [very eventful](https://wccftech.com/undead-labs-microsoft-not-messing-around/) few months.

> Phil Spencer at E3, announcing that Microsoft is aquiring Undead Labs

Looking ahead to a rather bigger future version of Undead Labs -- and a **State of Decay 3** that's even more ambitious than 2 was -- I've been doing a lot of code reviews on my existing code base to see what new hires will have to deal with.  

The results are not always pretty.  

On the purely functional side, the code has held up reasonably well.  But what jumps out at me when I read over it all is the hodgepodge of different styles.  Not only does the code reflect several different individual styles, it also shows distinct archaeological strata reflecting changes in my own style over the last eight years.  There's code that reads like C# (right down to C# naming conventions) and code that reads like MEL.  There's code that does everything in giant 1,000 line monster functions and code that can't seem to take a step without definining a new class.  

There's also plenty of duplication: no individual really knows the whole codebase very well.  Some people tend to reinvent their own solutions instead of looking around for what's already there.... while some people (myself definitely included!) are better at solving code problems than they are at naming their solutions, making it hard for colleagues to actually know that an answer is already there.

Untangling that Gordian knot is going to be a large project -- one of those things that you have to describe in meetings as "a process".  

I've [already shared](https://github.com/theodox/ta_101/blob/master/TA%20coding%20101.md) a draft of the doc I'm working on as part of the process.  It may be casually drescribed as a "coding standards" document, but that's not really a good description: who really gives a damn about things like where brackets go?  What I'm groping for -- and it's definitely an exploration -- is the right way to foster and grow a shared approach to problem solving.  Neat well organized code is certainly part of that, but it's only a small part.   The real end product of a process like this is not just better code: it's a better _coding culture_.  

It might be a bit suprising that I'd bother sharing what's essentially an internal policy document on the internet. But a lot of what I want to accomplish is to make it easier for new team members to know what's going on as they join Undead Labs; if my ideas are too far outsife of what you might call the "techart mainstream" it doesn't matter if I write them down and blather on about them.  The whole idea is not to create something radical and new -- it's to help clarify and crystallize the ideas we all half-way know already. 

There's useful analogy in the way that Python programmers use the word "Pythonic." It's an almost mystical quality -- and, like many mystical experiences, [the search for it often ends in controversy and feuding](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/13/python_creator_guido_van_rossum_quits/).  But even though "Pythonic" is not easily reducable to a set of Powerpoint bullets it's still a powerful ideal that has shaped a generation of Python code in both very obvious and very subtle ways. After spending much of the last two years in the depths of the Unreal C++ codebase, I'm extremely aware of the way that programming languages create their own cultures.  If you want an object lesson, Just watch some of the best C++ speakers, like [Scott Meyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smqT9Io_bKo) or [Herb Sutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnqTKD8uD64) and listen to the way they talk abou their language -- then contrast it to the way somebody like [Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) or [Brandon Rhodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kB2o8sd5c) talks about Python.  

**Code is culture.**

Hence, my immediate instinct to a looming cultural change at the company is to write a doc about coding.  But the target isn't just my own team -- it's all those future teammates out there that will have to learn the way we do things.  If we can somehow _scrape away_ the idiosyncracies of one team's history and get at the common, instinctual basis of TA work then onboarding new people will be a lot easier.  They'll be productive sooner, and we'll spend less energy trying to change _their_ habits into _our_ habits.  Instead of trying to invent a novel new culture, it's more about trying to clarify and articulate things that most TA's already know and do on some level. 

Python has it's famous [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).  What would a "Zen of technical art" look like?  I don't really know, but I think the next several months might met me a little closer.  If you're interested in the questions as well, I'd encourage you to grab that [coding document](https://github.com/theodox/ta_101/blob/master/TA%20coding%20101.md) and see how you'd re-write it. Feel free to lodge an issue on the github repo, or to submit a pull request if you think something could be better.
