    <h1>Lights</h1>
    

    <p>Unity lights are not physically simulated - the first thing you&#8217;ll notice is that by default they don&#8217;t cast shadows. On closer inspection you&#8217;ll also see that they don&#8217;t bounce: a bright light shining on a wall should diffuse some light over the area indirectly, but a Unity light does&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>There are 4 main light types (this is a summary, the real details are <a href="#http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Light.html">in the Unity Manual</a>, in order of render&nbsp;cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directional lights : these light along a direction, but don&#8217;t have a physical location. Even objects &#8216;behind&#8217; the 3d icon of the light will be lit by it.  Directional lights are somewhat cheaper to render than other&nbsp;lights.</li>
<li>Point lights: These shed light in all directions, like a light&nbsp;bulb.</li>
<li>Spot lights: These are cones with an adjustable falloff, handy for accent lighting. Spotlights can also be used to project slides-type images or fake shadows.  The calculations for spots are a little more involved, so they cost more than point&nbsp;lights.</li>
<li>Area lights: <strong>Area lights don&#8217;t work at run time</strong> They are, however, useful for <a href="glossary#bake">pre-baking lightmaps</a> if you want nice soft falloffs in your&nbsp;lightmaps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lighting&nbsp;budget</h3>
<p>All lights are really just being called by the <a href="glossary#shader">shaders</a> on your objects.  Each additional light in your scene requires extra calculation from every object in the scene (&#8220;Am I in range of the light? If so, what&#8217;s the angle between it an my surface normal?&#8221; etc).  For this reason lights can be a significant cost factor in your rendering budget. Small lights with limited ranges are cheaper than large one; fewer lights are cheaper than&nbsp;more.   </p>
<p>Most Unity shaders can be lit in two ways. &#8220;Pixel&#8221; lighting is more details and realistic; &#8220;Vertex&#8221; lighting is cheaper to render, but cruder.  Typically Unity automatically runs pixel lighting on &#8220;important&#8221; lights and vertex lighting on the rest to save rendering power. Importance is a bit hard to calculate, but basically its based on the <strong>Render Mode</strong> setting in the light itself.  Directional lights win a &#8220;tie&#8221; with other kinds of lights, and closer lights are more &#8220;important&#8221; than farther ones.  Many Unity games have an low-level flickery look caused by too many lights jostling for &#8216;importance&#8217; at render&nbsp;time. </p>
