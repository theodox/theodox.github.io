<h2>Software</h2>
<p><a id="extras"/></p>
<p>Here are a few free or cheap resources that you&#8217;ll find useful when working on your own outside the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">Sketchup</a></h3>
<p><img alt="sketchup" src="http://www.thinkdigit.com/uploads/dnldImg198x166_1320329232.png" /><br>
A free 3d modeling program from Google.  It can export models which Unity can display. It&#8217;s a fairly painless way to get into 3d modeling, although it&#8217;s not much use for characters or animations.  While Sketchup lessons are outside the scope of this class, there are <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/learn">good tutorials</a> available the the program is very friendly (as 3d modelling goes, anyway). Sketchup is available for Windows and <span class="caps">OSX</span>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender</a></h3>
<p><img alt="blender" src="http://wiki.blender.org/uploads/thumb/d/d3/Blender25withbbb.jpg/300px-Blender25withbbb.jpg" /><br>
A free, full-featured modeling and animation program that competes with professional tools.  Blender models can be exported into <a href="Glossary/#FBX"><span class="caps">FBX</span></a> format for use in Unity.  Blender is available for Windows, Linux and <span class="caps">OSX</span>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.cgtextures.com/">CGTextures.com</a></h3>
<p><img alt="cgtextures" src="http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2008/06/cg-textures.png" />
A website with lots and lots of royalty free photo textures which are correctly sized, cropped and edited for game applications.  You can get a free account which allows a limited number of downloads per day, or a paid account with much higher&nbsp;limits.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/">TurboSquid</a></h3>
<p><img alt="turbosquid" src="http://makingsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/turbosquid-e1373474002287.png" /><br>
Turbosquid sells 3d models and textures of all varieties (and, unfortunately, qualities). While they aren&#8217;t free, they can be a useful way to fill up your game world quickly - and some prices are quite low. Use models in <strong>.obj</strong> or <strong>.fbx</strong>&nbsp;format.</p>
<h3>If you have money to&nbsp;spare&#8230;.</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-3ds-max/overview">3dSMax</a>  and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview">Maya</a> Are the leading commercial packages modeling and animation - both are very powerful (and very expensive).  The do however include free&nbsp;trials.</p>
<p>For image editing, <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/">Photoshop</a> is the professional tool of choice. However you can use any program that edits standard image formats &#8212; look for software that can save files as .<span class="caps">PNG</span>, .<span class="caps">TIF</span>, or .<span class="caps">TGA</span>&nbsp;files. </p>
<p>If you want to do realistic graphics, <a href="http://www.crazybump.com/">Crazybump</a> is a very handy tool for creating <a href="http://vimeo.com/6155447">normal maps</a>.  <a href="http://www.xnormal.net/1.aspx">Xnormal</a> is another normal mapping tool, however it works by comparing the difference between high and low resolution versions of the same&nbsp;model.</p>
