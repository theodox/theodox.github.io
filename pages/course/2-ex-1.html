    <h1>Excersize&nbsp;2</h1>
    

    <h3>Prepare the&nbsp;scene.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import the Dalek.unityPackage from <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/unity%40makerhaus/week%202/dalek.unitypackage">here</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a new scene in Unity <strong>File &gt;&gt; New Scene&nbsp;(Ctrl+N)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Go the the <strong>Assets/dalek/unfinished</strong> folder.  If you have a fairly beefy computer, you can drop the model called <em>expensive</em> into the scene.  Medium machines can use <em>Dalek_LOD_1</em> and slower machines can use <em>Dalek_LOD_2</em>.  (&#8220;<span class="caps">LOD</span>&#8221; is the usual game term for &#8216;Level of Detail&#8217; - 0 is the most detailed and expensive model, 1 is less so, and so on).  Place the model in your&nbsp;scene.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Simple&nbsp;lighting.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a directional light <strong>GameObject &gt;&gt; Create Other &gt;&gt; Directional light</strong>.  </li>
<li>Make sure you&#8217;re using the light view in the Scene window: the light icon to the right of &#8220;<span class="caps">RGB</span>&#8221; should be&nbsp;checked.</li>
<li>Aim it at the Dalek using the Rotate tool (<strong>R key</strong>)</li>
<li>Give it a slight color tint. Yellow (255, 255, 220) is a decent starting point, but it&#8217;s your&nbsp;choice.</li>
<li>Add a point light <strong>GameObject &gt;&gt; Create Other &gt;&gt; Point Light</strong>,</li>
<li>Give the point light a contrasting color to the directional (If you have a yellow directional, try blue, for&nbsp;example)</li>
<li>Move the light so that it illuminates the opposite side of the dalek from the main&nbsp;light</li>
<li>Adjust the ambient light to get a feel for how it works.  <strong>Edit &gt;&gt; Render Settings</strong>. </li>
<li>Add a couple of cubes and cylinders to the scene. They always start with a default white shader, so they make a good lighting reference to help you figure out how much of what you&#8217;re seeing is coming from lights and how much comes from materials.  If the cubes are whited out, your lights are probably too hot; if they are very dark, you need more&nbsp;light.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Diffuse vs specular&nbsp;shading</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tumble the view around. You&#8217;ll notice that the lighting should not change no matter how you view the&nbsp;scene.</li>
<li>Select the dalek. Find the &#8220;Skin&#8221; material in the inspector.  Set the Skin material&#8217;s shader to <em>Specular</em></li>
<li>Turn the diffuse illumination down to nothing by setting the <strong>Main Color</strong> to black.  Tumble the view around and see how the highlights&nbsp;behave.</li>
<li>Play with the shininess control to see how that changes the size of the&nbsp;highlight.  </li>
<li>Move the point light around and observe how the highlights travel.  Do the same with the directional light and note the difference in&nbsp;behavior</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Adding&nbsp;textures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add the texture <strong>Assets/dalek/textures/dalek_skin</strong> to the Base Color texture of the material (drag the texture onto the swatch or use the &#8216;select&#8217; button). You won&#8217;t see a change on the model if your diffuse value is still set to&nbsp;black</li>
<li>Set the main color to white. You&#8217;ll see the base texture&nbsp;now.</li>
<li>Experiment with the balance between the brightness of the main texture and the specular color. Try a dull greenish color for the main texture and orange for the specular to get a gold effect. Play with the shininess value to get a good metallic&nbsp;look.</li>
<li>Now try for a red or blue plastic look - a very white highlight, a high shininess value,  and a saturated mid-value main&nbsp;color.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Contrasting&nbsp;materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shininess of your specular materials works better when contrasted against the matte behavior.  Find the <em>rubber</em> material: you can select it from the dalek models inspector or by looking for it in <strong>Assets/dalek/unfinished/materials</strong>.</li>
<li>Add the same <strong>dalek_skin</strong> texture to the rubber material you did to the dalek&nbsp;skin.</li>
<li>Use the main color swatch to take out the yellow, by tinting the texture blueish.  A value of about (75,85,125) will turn the texture matte&nbsp;gray.</li>
<li>Tumble the view and move the lights, note how the contrast between the matte rubber and shiny body emphasizes the&nbsp;differences</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Reflective&nbsp;materials.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now grab the <em>steel</em> material. You can find it by selecting one of the dalek&#8217;s guns directly, or in the <strong>Assets/dalek/unfinished/materials</strong>&nbsp;folder</li>
<li>Set the shader type to <strong>Reflective &gt;&gt; Difuse</strong> in the shader&nbsp;dropdown.</li>
<li>Turn the main color to black so you can focus on the reflection&nbsp;effect.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll see two texture slots. Add <strong>Assets/dalek/textures/reflection map</strong> to the <em>Reflection Cubemap</em>&nbsp;slot.</li>
<li>Note the chrome appearance of the metal pieces - how the bottoms are dark and the upward facing surfaces are shiny. If you change your viewpoint you can see the texture change. The effect is similar to a specular highlight but it includes lots of smaller details as&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>Note that this purely reflective shader <em>ignores</em> all the lights. Reflection maps often look odd on large moving objects, since they don&#8217;t move&nbsp;themselves.</li>
<li>Adjust the main and reflective colors to get a good chrome look that&#8217;s not too shiny compared to the rest of the&nbsp;scene.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Play&nbsp;time</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take a few minutes to set up the rest of you dalek&#8217;s textures and materials (if you need inspiration try <a href="http://hashtagstudios.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hybrid-coloured-daleks-1440x900.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://media.creativebloq.futurecdn.net/sites/creativebloq.com/files/images/2013/03/dalek1.jpg">here</a>  or <a href="http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100519091761/tardis/images/a/ab/Daleks.jpg">here</a>)</li>
