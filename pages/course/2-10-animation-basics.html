    <h1>Animation&nbsp;basics</h1>
    

    <p>From a purely <em>technical</em> perspective, computer animation is about controlling the change in numbers over time.  Unity does a pretty good job of letting you handle that aspect with a built in tool. That said, most of the animation in your game will be done in other software &#8212; Unity is fine for animating individual objects or changing shaders, but it&#8217;s not a character animation package on its&nbsp;own. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the <strong>artform</strong> of animation is a very big, complex topic. We&#8217;re not going to get into the art form this time out. If you want to study up on that, check out <a href="http://www.theanimatorssurvivalkit.com/index.html">Richard Williams&#8217; website</a>  or buy a copy of <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/illusion-of-life-frank-thomas/1102678914?ean=9780786860708"><em>The Illustion of Life</em></a> Another option (If you are able to model or buy characters but are intimidated by character animation) is  <a href="http://www.mixamo.com/">Mixamo</a> a website which will add motion captured generic animations onto your&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p>Unity&#8217;s animation interface is available under <strong>Windows &gt;&gt; Animation</strong> (note it&#8217;s <em>Animation</em> and not <strong>Animator</strong>, which is a new system that is going to replace the &#8216;legacy&#8217; system we&#8217;re covering today.  You can also get to the animation <span class="caps">UI</span> with <strong>command/ctrl +&nbsp;6</strong></p>
<p><img alt="example" src="http://media.moddb.com/images/articles/1/52/51573/auto/Learning20the20Interface-36.jpg" /></p>
<p>The animation window has four main&nbsp;parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vcr-like control at top&nbsp;left</li>
<li>A timeline at the top&nbsp;right</li>
<li>A list of objects and animatable properties at the&nbsp;left</li>
<li>A <strong>Graph view</strong> at the&nbsp;right</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding the graph view&nbsp;display</h3>
<p>The graph view is the most unusual. It shows the way values change over time. In the example above, the cube&#8217;s rotation in Y starts around 0, climbs to just over 180 degrees at about 1 and a half seconds and levels&nbsp;off.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong> <em>The times are in timecode:  0:30 is 30/60ths of a second; 1:00 is one second, 1:30 is 1.5 seconds,&nbsp;etc.</em></p>
<p>The dots on the colored line are &#8216;keyframes&#8217; values that are set by hand, saying &#8216;have this value at this time&#8217;.  The lines connecting the dots are &#8216;in-betweens&#8217; or &#8216;tweens&#8217; for short - mathematical interpolations between the&nbsp;keys.</p>
<p>The interpolation is controlled by setting <em>tangents</em> at the key frames. A tangent describes how fast or slowly to interpolate the values at that key (if you&#8217;ve used Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop curves, tangents are like curve handles).
  &#8216;Flat&#8217; tangents slow down the change of values near the keys; steeper tangents indicate a quick change in the&nbsp;numbers.  </p>
<p>To set the tangents for a key, you can right click on it in the animation window and choose a tangent type. If the tangents are editable they show up as handles like those in&nbsp;Photoshop.</p>
