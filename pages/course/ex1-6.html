    <h1>Creating a bowling pin&nbsp;prefab</h1>
    

    <p>Now that we have one bowling pin, we&#8217;d like to make more. We&#8217;ll create a <a href="glossary#prefab">prefab</a> so that all of our pins will behave the same way (and later, when we add more components to control the pins, we won&#8217;t have to add 10 components - only&nbsp;one!).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find your pin in the hierarchy window.
   <p/><img alt="hwindow" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/Unity%40makerhaus/gfx/Screenshot%202013-10-12%2021.48.13.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your project window back to the main folder.
   <p/><img alt="proj" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/Unity%40makerhaus/gfx/Screenshot%202013-10-12%2021.50.57.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>Right click in the project window and create a new folder. Call it &#8216;prefabs&#8217; so you can find it later.  Open up the&nbsp;folder.</li>
<li>Now drag the bowling pin from the hierarchy window to your folder. It will appear as an icon similar to the model icon you saw when you first imported it (but without the triangle button on the right side). This is your bowling pin prefab. When you place the other bowling pins you can drag this &#8212; instead of the original model &#8212; into your hierarchy window.<blockquote>
<p>If you select the icon and check the bottom of your prefab window, you&#8217;ll notice that you&#8217;ve actually created a file on disk (called &#8220;bowling pin.prefab&#8221;, or whatever name you called the bowling pin in your&nbsp;scene.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Add a copy of the prefab back to your main scene by dragging the prefab icon into your hierarchy window.  You&#8217;ll notice that the prefabs, unlike the other items in the scene, are listed in blue text. 
  <p/><img alt="prefab" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/Unity%40makerhaus/gfx/Screenshot%202013-10-12%2021.52.44.png" /><blockquote>
<p>If you make changes to one copy of a prefab, so that it doesn&#8217;t match the original, it will turn pink in the hierarchy view to let you know that it will not be updated if the prefab changes. Sometimes you want this behavior, and sometimes you&nbsp;don&#8217;t. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Dragging the prefab into place 10 times is tedious. You can speed up the process by using <strong>Edit &gt; Duplicate</strong> (<strong>Ctrl+D</strong>) with one or more of the prefabs selected in the scene. Duplicate until you have 10&nbsp;copies.</li>
<li>Now you&#8217;ll want to move them into the right positions. For moving several items at a time you can selected several things and type the values you want into the inspector. You want to position the so that each row is about .2 units behind the previous one and the pins are .2 units apart. You can start by grabbing the 2d, and 3rd pins in the list and typing -.2 for their X position. Then grab the 4th, 5th and 6th and set the X value to -.4. Grab the remaining 4 items and set their X position to&nbsp;-.8;</li>
<li>Use the move tool or the inspector to arrange the pins in the usual formation. The first row will be at Z=.1 and Z=-.1, the second row at Z=.2, z=0, and z=-.2, and so&nbsp;forth.</li>
<li>After all that work you should have a complete set of pins. This is a good time to save your scene with <strong>File &gt; Save </strong> or <strong>Ctrl+S</strong>.</li>
