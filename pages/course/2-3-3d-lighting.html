    <h1>3D&nbsp;Lighting</h1>
    

    <p>Lights are objects in the scene, with their own <a href="glossary#transform">transforms</a>. They can be attached to other objects (for example, headlights on a car).  The computer uses the position of the light and the <a href="glossary#normal">normals</a> of the <a href="glossary#mesh">meshes</a> in the scene to figure out how bright something&nbsp;is. </p>
<p>In the real world, there are many subtleties in how objects appear to the eye, depending on the physics of the lighting, the atmosphere, and the materials involved. Computers can&#8217;t handle all of that in real time. Instead, there are a bunch of standard techniques which work as &#8216;building blocks&#8217; to create complex effects. Ideally you&#8217;ll choose as few of these as you can to get the results you need, saving on both rendering power and memory cost of your&nbsp;game.  </p>
<h4>Diffuse, Specular, Reflectivity and Ambience: the building&nbsp;blocks</h4>
<p>The game uses shaders &#8212; small, highly specialized sub programs &#8212; to render your effects on screen. Every Unity <a href="glossary#material">material</a> can have its own shader. Most shaders are just mix-and-match collections of the techniques we&#8217;ll go over&nbsp;next.</p>

<h4>Side note: Dynamic range and <span class="caps">HDR</span></h4>
<p>All computer images can only range from black pixels to white ones. In real life, a &#8216;white&#8217; piece of paper under indoor lighting will be from 400 to 1000 times dimmer than a &#8216;white&#8217; cloud in an afternoon sky; on a computer screen they will be exactly the same pixel&nbsp;color.  </p>
<p>In the real world, Your eye automatically adjusts so that the darkest things you see are &#8216;black&#8217; and the lightest &#8216;white&#8217; - but you know instinctively that there is a difference (as you can tell when you walk from a dark room into full sunlight and you need a second or two to adjust).  In graphics 
 we call that &#8216;High Dynamic Range&#8217; or <span class="caps">HDR</span>.  </p>
<p>In <span class="caps">HDR</span> rendering each pixel is stored with a value that tells it&#8217;s brightness in absolute terms.  Working with <span class="caps">HDR</span> is a complex task because the computer has to do the same kind of adaptation to different brightness values that your eyes do. If you&#8217;re curious (and plan on getting Unity Pro) you can <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/HDR.html">read about it&nbsp;here.</a></p>
