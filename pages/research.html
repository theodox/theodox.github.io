    <h1>Interesting graphics and animation&nbsp;research</h1>
    

    <p>This page is a list of interesting,  maybe not-quite-ready-real time graphics and animation tech that I&#8217;m keeping an eye on. Should be growing over&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3>Rendering</h3>
<p>Anybody in games should be interested in the fate of <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a>, the no-uvs, variable resolution texturing system from Disney and used in, for example, <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/mari/">Mari</a>.  So far, it&#8217;s not ready for runtime graphics. but <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gamedev/docs/Borderless%20Ptex.pdf">this Nvidia slideset</a> discusses a realtime implementation.  It claims to be only 15% slower than a <span class="caps">UV</span> mapped alternative - while saving about 18% of texture memory.  I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it, but i <em>want</em> to believe. ( <strong>Update: </strong><em>I went over this with our residence graphics genius and he doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll fly, even on XBone / <span class="caps">PS4</span> class&nbsp;hardware)</em></p>
<p>A <a href="http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/PE/VMV/VMV12/063-070.pdf.abstract.pdf;internal&amp;action=action.digitallibrary.ShowPaperAbstract"><span class="caps">GPU</span> Gem</a> on doing hardware aging of materials using <span class="caps">GPU</span> particles. Can&#8217;t wait to see this get out from behind the&nbsp;paywall!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/joint-importance-sampling/">Joint Importance Sampling</a>: a paper from Disney on a better way to render path-traced media like fog or water.  Claims to increase render times 1000x for little change in quality! And it&#8217;s <em>still</em> too slow for games&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>A <a href="http://ppsloan.org/publications/mrtSA.pdf">new(ish) paper</a> from <a href="http://ppsloan.org/">Peter-Pike Sloan</a> proposing a method for low-res, realtime friendly pseudo gi lighting.  The new hardware generation is not going to make realtime <span class="caps">GI</span> happen with <a href="http://cg.ibds.kit.edu/publications/p2011/DGIWTCLPV_Kaplanyan_2011/DGIWTCLPV_Kaplanyan_2011.html">the current techniques,</a> so new ways of looking at <span class="caps">GI</span> are&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>Also from <span class="caps">PPS</span> and Bungie, a review of the <a href="http://ppsloan.org/publications/BungieBake.pdf">hardware-based <span class="caps">AO</span> bake system used on Destiny</a>.  Note that in this example &#8220;<span class="caps">AO</span>&#8221; is &#8220;ambient obscurance&#8221; rather than &#8220;ambient occlusion&#8221; - obscurance accounts for distance to light sources, where as tradtional occlusion is&nbsp;dimensionless.</p>
<p>A neat paper from Sebastian Lagarde on <a href="http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/observe-rainy-world/">rendering wet surfaces in a physically based environment</a>.  <a href="http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/">Seb&#8217;s blog</a> is a top-notch reference for anybody doing Physically based rendering (which means most of us by about&nbsp;2015)</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p><a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/motion-fields/motion-fields.pdf">Motion fields</a>  &#8220;Motion graphs&#8221; - basically efficiently seaming together  a desired set of Mocap data  - has been a big deal in academia for a long time, but it&#8217;s never caught on in games due to the Prince of Persia problem: it&#8217;s too realistic and thus not responsive enough. This work from the graphics group at <span class="caps">UW</span> is an interesting slant on making this more reactive.  Unfortunately @ZoranPopovic has largely moved on to education from animation, but his <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/">group&#8217;s page at <span class="caps">UW</span> </a>has a lot of interesting work from the last 5-6&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Kevin Wampler&#8217;s work on procededural animation. <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/">This paper</a> from 2009 describes a (slow, offline, but _cool) _process for generating decent gaits for arbitrarily shaped creatures. Check out the <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/movs/morphology.avi">videos</a> (note: big download, requires divx).  <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~geijt101/papers/SA2013/">This one</a> from the Netherlands is a similar optimization based approach to bipeds only - the big wrinkle being that everything in this one runs on simulated muscle networks rather than pure joint motors. Fun&nbsp;stuff!</p>
<p>This is an <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jtan34/project/softBodyLocomotion.html">interesting paper from Karen Liu&#8217;s group at Georgia Tech</a>, featuring soft body simulation done with a combination of finite element modeling and a muscle fiber system. Soft body animation remains a pretty black art, it would be great if it catches on in realtime-friendly ways. Not holding my breath,&nbsp;alas.</p>
<p><a href="http://aigamedev.com/open/access/overgrowth/">This talk from the developer of Overgrowh </a>is an interesting look at hybrid physical-kinematic animations, a sort of  &#8216;Euphoria Lite&#8217;.  Some related references from <a href="http://aigamedev.com/open/editorial/animation-revolution/">AIGameDev</a>.  Also related is <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/search.php#&amp;category=free&amp;firstfocus=&amp;keyword=lico&amp;conference_id=">Rick Lico&#8217;s talk from <span class="caps">GDC</span> 2014</a> about the Destiny animation system (<span class="caps">GDC</span> vault&nbsp;paywall).</p>
<h3>Procedural&nbsp;worlds</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested in procedural worlds for <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/16/4-hours-in-state-of-decays-open-world-zombie-nightmare">obvious reasons</a>.  It&#8217;s an area that&#8217;s got enornous potential but has been moving very slowly in the game side of&nbsp;things.</p>
<p><a href="http://hss.ulb.uni-bonn.de/2013/3124/3124.pdf">The early chapters of this dissertation</a> provides a decent overview of lots of the terminology and existing work in the&nbsp;field</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine">CityEngine, </a> which looks good if you&#8217;re looking at city size data sets (and it <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine/features">supports python</a>!)  There are a lot of nice procedural terrain packages but they all look very fractal-y to me  nowadays; it was impressive in <em>Wrath of Khan</em> but hasn&#8217;t moved on much since. The most interesting terrain paper I&#8217;ve seen in a while is <a href="http://hpcg.purdue.edu/?page=publication&amp;id=170">this one</a>, which uses rivers as the structural basis for terrain&nbsp;generation..</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/urban/urban-procedural-modeling.html">collection of papers from Purdue</a> on procedural land use - thing like zoning and road layout. Some of this looks pretty handy.   If it gets scary, just remember &#8216;markov chain&#8217;  is math-speak for &#8216;state machine&#8217;, more or less.  The other fun aspect is their efforts to  &#8216;inverse model&#8217; the stuff they study - to turn real data into the data their model&nbsp;uses.</p>

<h3>Meshes, models, and&nbsp;surfaces</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~keenan/Projects/GloballyOptimalDirectionFields/paper.pdf">This paper from Columbia</a> promises an optimal way of establishing surface flow across arbitrary surfaces. This is interesting for a couple of reasons - it might be an interesting improvement to mesh-based navigation, and it might also lead to alternate methods of automatic <span class="caps">UV</span>&nbsp;generation.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/ShefferPraunRose.pdf">decent roundup of mesh parameterization&nbsp;techniques</a></p>
