  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>By a certain stroke of cosmic irony, it was just after I finished shoe-horning lame <em>Star Wars</em> jokes into my last post that I started to get obsessed with <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>, one of the plethora of competitive coding sites that have sprung up in the last few&nbsp;years.   </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vc-eVNbzo1Q/VcZdEcRBhXI/AAAAAAABMag/NYI22iT0zro/s1600/cw.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vc-eVNbzo1Q/VcZdEcRBhXI/AAAAAAABMag/NYI22iT0zro/s400/cw.png" /></a></p>
<p>Mostly I find that sort of thing pretty annoying – it’s a genre that all too easily degenerates into macho brogrammer chest-thumping. 90 percent of the code I see on those sites is so tightly knotted – in hopes of scoring fewest-number-of-lines bragging rights – that it’s useless for learning. I’m impressed as hell by&nbsp;this:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>f=lambda s:next((t,k)for t,k in map(lambda i:(s[:i],len(s)/i),range(1,len(s)+1))if t*k==s)
</pre></div>


<p>but I never want to have to <em>interact</em> with it (Bonus points if you can tell what it does! Post your answer in the&nbsp;comments&#8230;.)  </p>
<p>The nice thing about Codewars is that the experience tends to push you into thinking about how to solve the problems, rather than how to maximize your&nbsp;score. </p>
<p>I particularly like two things: first, the site includes a built-in test framework so you can do The Right Thing<sup>tm</sup> and write the tests before you write the code – not only is it a helpful touch for would-be problem solvers its very effective ‘propaganda of the deed’ for encouranging people to take tests&nbsp;seriously. </p>
<p>Second, the site doesn’t just show you the ‘best’ solutions, it shows you all of them – and it allows you to vote both for solutions you think are clever and ones you think embody “best practices.” That snippet I posted above is extremely <em>clever</em> but not a best practice – I wouldn’t let something like that into my codebase if I could avoid it! I’m not smart enough to unriddle such things, though I’m glad they&nbsp;exist.  </p>
<p>The other nice thing is that most of the problems are bite-sized, the sort of thing you can chew on while waiting for a longish perforce sync to complete. It’s a great way to practice you coding chops outside all the gnarly things that come with working in a particular problems set for work. I’ve had a work task which involved me in a lot of 5-minute wait times this week and I found CodeWars to be a nice chance to do keep my brains warm while waiting for&nbsp;Perforce.  </p>
<p>So, if you’re looking to sharpen up your coding skills you should definitely check out <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a>. My username is <em>Theodox</em> and in the goofy ninja-academy language of Codewars we can form an ‘alliance’ by following one another. We can make technical art a power in the land!<br />
On the practical side: codewars supports Python, Javascript, and several other languages – they just added C#. It’s great way to get familiar with new syntaxes and to see how folks who know what they are doing tackle problems natively, it’s a great tool to pick up a new language on your own. Give it a&nbsp;shot!  </p>
