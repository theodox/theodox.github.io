  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Some kinds of pain are just occasional: you stub your toe or bump your head, ouch, and then its&nbsp;over. </p>
<p>Other kinds of pain aren&#8217;t as sharp or as sudden&#8230; but they&#8217;re chronic.  That persistent twinge in your lower back may not hurt as much as a twisted ankle - but it&#8217;s going to be there forever (at least unless you get into Power Yoga, or so my wife&nbsp;claims).  </p>
<p>Maya is old enough to have a few of those chronic pains, and I just ran in to one which &#8212; once we debugged it and figured it out &#8212; I realized has been a persistant irritant for at least the last decade; if my creaky old memory does not lie it&#8217;s been a distinct pain in the butt since at least 2002 and it may very well go back all the way to Maya&nbsp;1.0. </p>
<p>In another context I might even have been able to diagnose it but instead we spent a ton of time and energy working around an unexpected behavior which is, in fact, purely standard Maya. It&#8217;s <em>stupid</em> Maya, but it&#8217;s standard too.  Maya, alas, is <strong>double plus ungood</strong> about mixing per-face and per-object material assignments. So, I figured I&#8217;d document this here for future sufferers: it might not ease the pain much, but at least you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re not&nbsp;crazy.  </p>
<p>The basic problem is that assigning materials to faces and to objects use slightly different mechanisms. If you check your hypergraph you&#8217;ll see that per-face assignments connect to their shadingGroup nodes through the <code>compInstObjectGroups[]</code> attribute while object-level assigmemts go through the similar-but-not-identical <code>instObjectGroups</code> attribute (if you&#8217;re looking for these in the docs, the component cone is inherited from the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/Nodes/geometryShape.html"><code>geometryShape</code></a> class and the object version comes from <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/Nodes/dagNode.html"><code>dagNode</code></a>).  </p>
<p>As long as you&#8217;re working with one object at a time this isn&#8217;t a problem. However, if you&#8217;re duplicating or copy-pasting nodes, there&#8217;s a gotcha:  If you ever try to merge meshes which have a mix of per-face and per-object assignments, Maya will magically &#8220;remember&#8221; old per-face assigments in the combined mesh.  If you&#8217;re a masochist, here&#8217;s the&nbsp;repro:  </p>
<ol>
<li>create a object, give it a couple of different materials on different&nbsp;faces</li>
<li>duplicate it a couple of&nbsp;times</li>
<li>assign a per-object material to the duplicates, overriding the original per-face&nbsp;assignments</li>
<li>combine all the&nbsp;meshes.</li>
<li><em>Et voîla!</em> The cloned meshes revert to their original&nbsp;assignments</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WHA-mYamWSw/VjBfoXDF_4I/AAAAAAABMuY/BtrR34QPRhM/s1600/pasted_image_at_2015_10_23_05_32_pm_720.png"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WHA-mYamWSw/VjBfoXDF_4I/AAAAAAABMuY/BtrR34QPRhM/s640/pasted_image_at_2015_10_23_05_32_pm_720.png" /></a></p>
<p>What appears to happen is that those <code>compInstObjectGroups</code> connections are driven by hidden <code>groupID</code> nodes which don&#8217;t get deleted when the per-face assignments are overridden by the per-object ones in step (3) .  They stick around even though they aren&#8217;t being used, and when the mesh is combined they step right back into their original&nbsp;roles.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing this interactively it&#8217;s an annoyance. If you&#8217;re got tools that do things like auto-combine meshes to cut down on transform load in your game&#8230;. well, it&#8217;s a source of some surprising bugs and equally surprising bursts of profanity.  But at least it&#8217;ss&nbsp;predictable.</p>
<p>The workaround:  Before doing any mesh combination first delete the existing history then add something harmless to meshes you&#8217;re about to combine. (I use a triangulate step, since this happens only at export time). That kills the rogue <code>groupID</code> nodes and keeps the combined mesh looking the way you&nbsp;intended.</p>
<p>Sheesh. What a way to make a&nbsp;living.</p>
