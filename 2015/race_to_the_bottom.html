  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I&#8217;m notorious for issuing gloomy pronouncements at <span class="caps">GDC</span> and elsewhere about the long term decline in artist pay.  I often point out that my starting salary in 1995 was about what an 6-year veteran makes today.  Maybe I&#8217;m just trying to scare the fainthearted out of the business and drive prices back&nbsp;up.  </p>
<p>Still, my complaints are nothing compared to what&#8217;s been going in the <span class="caps">VFX</span> industry.  The latest victim is <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/breaking-dreamworks-animation-will-shut-down-pdidreamworks-studio-over-500-jobs-will-be-eliminated-108161.html"><span class="caps">PDI</span></a>, which will be laying off 500 people.  While games has had it&#8217;s ups and downs the last few years, <span class="caps">VFX</span> has had a brutal time with lots of closures and&nbsp;disruptions.   </p>
<p>In that connection I came across <a href="https://vfxsoldier.wordpress.com/">VFXSoldier </a>, a site which has been fighting for more unionization in the <span class="caps">VFX</span> world.  While I&#8217;m deeply ambivalent about unionizing in <span class="caps">CG</span> &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s really <em>possible,</em> much less if it&#8217;s a good idea &#8212; but it&#8217;s certainly not something to dismiss without thinking about and it is hard to see how it could make life worse for the poor <span class="caps">VFX</span> folks.  It&#8217;s a worthwhile read just to see how the other half lives. I&#8217;m curious to hear what others&nbsp;think.  </p>
