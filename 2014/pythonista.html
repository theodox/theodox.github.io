  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>If you consider yourself a Pythonista, you&#8217;ve probably been frustrated by the difficulty involved in getting to work in Python on iOS devices.  I just stumbled upon a really cool answer to your prayers in the form of <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a>. It&#8217;s not brand new - it looks like it came out last year - but I just found out about it and flipped my proverbial&nbsp;wig.  </p>
<p>Pythonista is a sandboxed Python 2.7 development environment for iOS.  It borrows a page from the playbook of earlier sandboxes like <a href="http://twolivesleft.com/Codea/">Codea</a>. and manages to skirt Apple&#8217;s rules for what you can do on the device while still allowing plenty of power.  It includes a script editor (a pretty slick one for iOS, by the way) ,an interactive environment, and a bunch of libraries to make development really useful.  Among the &#8216;batteries&#8217; included are heavy hitters like <code>pil</code>,<code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, along with a few cool little things like a text-to-speech module and tools for dealing with the iOS&nbsp;console.</p>
<p>The most impressive inclusions are the <code>scene</code> and <code>ui</code> modules: custom modules devoted to iOS drawing and <span class="caps">UI</span>.  Ironically, it&#8217;s easier to develop a <span class="caps">GUI</span> application on your iPad using Pythonista than it is to do it on a desktop machine - the app even comes with a <span class="caps">UI</span> builder tool similar to <span class="caps">QT</span>&#8217;s interface builder (not nearly as deep or complex, of course, but iOS <span class="caps">UI</span> is less complex than desktop). You can read multiple touches.  You can even do hardware accelerate drawing - nice for things like a finger-sketching program.  Since Pythonista includes <code>pil</code>, you can even do stuff like image&nbsp;processing:  </p>

<p>Pythonista&#8217;s main limitation is that it&#8217;s not possible to add external modules to the library in the usual ways: <code>setuptools</code> and <code>pip</code> aren&#8217;t available.  You can manually install pure-python modules by copy-paste-save, and there are few installation tools floating around on the web such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/pudquick/4116558">pipista</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5243199">Pypi</a>.  (As an aside: here&#8217;s a <a href="http://randomfoo.net/2013/12/08/pythonista-and-ios-automation">handy collection of Pythonista snippets and links</a>).  Modules with binary dependencies &#8212; such as the perforce api &#8212; are off-limits; I&#8217;m not sure it it would be possible to use .pyd&#8217;s that were properly compiled for iOS or if the security sandbox won&#8217;t allow arbitrary binary code at&nbsp;all.  </p>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s pretty cool stuff for any Pythonerd.  My big project right now is a touch based inteface on the iPad to control a <a href="http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/">BrickPi</a> Mindstorms robot, but at some point I think an asset-database / issue tracker client on the iPad would be a handy tool for our production team&nbsp;.  </p>
<p>All in all, pretty cool for&nbsp;$6.99!</p>
