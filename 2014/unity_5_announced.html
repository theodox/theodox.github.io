  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So it looks like Unity <a href="http://unity3d.com/5">is announcing Unity 5 a bit early</a>.   It&#8217;s a bit premature, since they are not done with the much anticipated 4.6 release (I&#8217;ve been wrestling with the existing, awful Unitry <span class="caps">GUI</span> system for months and I <strong>can&#8217;t freaking wait</strong> to push it over the&nbsp;gunwale!)   </p>
<p><a href="http://unity3d.com/profiles/unity3d/themes/unity/images/pages/unity5/slider/doll2.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://unity3d.com/profiles/unity3d/themes/unity/images/pages/unity5/slider/doll2.jpg" /></a>  </p>
<h2>Key points of&nbsp;interest:</h2>
<h4>They are integrating the realtime <span class="caps">GI</span> middleware <a href="http://www.geomerics.com/">Enlighten </a></h4>
<p>This is an interesting choice on a couple of levels; for one thing, I&#8217;m not sure most platforms out there are quite ready for realtime <span class="caps">GI</span> yet &#8212; while you can <em>do</em> it, as Crytek has been doing for a couple of years, it&#8217;s hard to do it in a real production environment with real assets and (more importantly) real performance constraints.  I wonder how many current Unity users really need this?  Given that Unity perf generally lags more traditional engines thanks to the C# layer switch costs and managed memory, I&#8217;m a bit surprised they took on something so high end.   They advertise this as &#8216;mobile ready&#8217; - I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it. <a href="https://www.marmoset.co/skyshop">SkyShop </a>makes gorgeous pictures on an iPad  - at around 20 fps for one object on&nbsp;screen. </p>
<p>That said, it does make really pretty&nbsp;demos.</p>
<h4>Physically based&nbsp;shaders.</h4>
<p>This is very interesting, but the devil is in the details;  physically correct rendering is a very appealing idea, and is hard to beat when done right; but the mental and artistic adjustment costs can be pretty significant if you&#8217;ve been doing traditional anything-goes rendering for a decade or more.  Will be very interested to see if they manage to popularize this&nbsp;approach.</p>
<h4>A 64 bit version of the&nbsp;editor.</h4>
<p>How will this play out with the notoriously flaky <span class="caps">GUID</span> system in unity? And honestly, I&#8217;d take a 32 bit version that <a href="http://tech-artists.org/forum/showthread.php?4584-Studio-Switching-to-Perforce-need-good-introduction-ramp-up">integrated better with source control</a> and was better adapted to collaborative work environments.  And &#8216;<a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/48088-Prefab-saving-question">save my goddam prefab</a>&#8216; would also be&nbsp;nice.  </p>
<p>On the other hand it looks like they&#8217;re also making the editor more multi-core friendly, which gives me another reason to buy that <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> I&#8217;ve been dreaming&nbsp;of. </p>
<h4>More direct control over blend weights in&nbsp;Mecanim.</h4>
<p>The recent addition of <code>CrossFade()</code> and <code>Play()</code> is already a big step forward, but this seems like even more belated recognition that the original was too doctrinaire. Who, exactly, thought that an animation system that <em>didn&#8217;t let you tell it what animations to play</em> was a good&nbsp;idea?  </p>
<p>The most exciting bullet on animation though is a real headsmacking &#8216;Oh of course&#8217; things: the ability to add behavior scripts directly to animation states. This should go a <em>long</em> way to enabling much more interesting &#8212; and comprehensible &#8212; procedural animation code. I&#8217;m <em>very&nbsp;excited.</em></p>
<h4>Forking the web player between the old plugin and&nbsp;WebGL</h4>
<p>you&#8217;ll be able to publish to the traditional web player plugin, or to WebGL. Interesting to see how that plays out - I wonder if it will affect security sandbox issues with the web player. I&#8217;m still wishing it was easier to write real 3-d tools that could be published on the web, ala <a href="http://clara.o/">clara.o</a>.  </p>
<p>Of course, once you get into _interesting _stuff, like shader work, &#8220;write once run anywhere&#8221; gets a little more difficult (I&#8217;ve been battling stencil shader difference between <span class="caps">PC</span>, <span class="caps">IOS</span> and Android for a while now, so I&#8217;m prejudiced).  Will this make it even&nbsp;dicier?  </p>
<h4>A new audio&nbsp;system.</h4>
<p>Not my area, but given the complaints I&#8217;ve heard from audio guys any change is probably for the&nbsp;good.  </p>
