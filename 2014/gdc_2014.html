    <p>Well, another year, another <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/"><span class="caps">GDC</span></a>.  </p>
<p>An upbeat show - the combination of the indie/mobile tidal wave and a new console generation has breathed some much needed life into the old beast - the business center was bigger than I&#8217;ve seen it in years, and full of people&nbsp;hustling.  </p>
<h2><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FbM1i70bco8/Uy51CRDoDiI/AAAAAAABIBY/8_SGnjlJxeM/s1600/GDC.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FbM1i70bco8/Uy51CRDoDiI/AAAAAAABIBY/8_SGnjlJxeM/s1600/GDC.jpg" /></a></h2>
<p>The floor was&nbsp;buzzing!  </p>
<p>The absence of many familiar <span class="caps">AAA</span> names was still pretty striking - no lines around the block for the Activision/<span class="caps">EA</span> meat markets, no scores of kids waiting to show their portfolios to someone from Blizzard or&nbsp;whatnot.  </p>
<p>There was, however, a booth from <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>. Someboedy told me they are <em>hiring tech artists</em>.  See, we&#8217;re conquering the world&#8230; from&nbsp;above!  </p>
<p>And, there was an amazing bustle of activity from the indie-casual-mobile side. Tons and tons of booths, more than I remember ever seeing before. Most of them will probably be gone in two years, but it&#8217;s still great to see people hustling around, coming up with plans, and trying to make something big after all the gloom of the last few years.  Here&#8217;s hoping the many friends and former colleagues who&#8217;ve been battered by business can make up some lost ground in this new gold rush.  It&#8217;s probably another bubble - remember when everybody wanted to hire a teal of 800 to talk on <span class="caps">WOW</span>? - but it&#8217;s still better than sitting around&nbsp;moping.   </p>
<p>All the movement has a lot to do with all the changes in the business that have broken the stifling rut of <span class="caps">AAA</span> juggernauts, sequel-itis, and me-too design that was hanging over us like a fog a few years back. All sorts of fun and interesting stuff&nbsp;happening.   </p>
<p>Saw some cool tech too, which I&#8217;ll talk about later in the week. In the meantime: so long <span class="caps">SF</span>!  </p>
<p>Update: I did not see this talk, but <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GregCostikyan/20140324/213784/2014_GDC_Rant_We_Had_a_Good_10_Years_But_the_Walls_are_Closing_In.php">this rant from Greg Costikyan</a> does summarize neatly some things I am worrying about over the long&nbsp;haul&#8230;  </p>
