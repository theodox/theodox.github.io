    <h2>#1: Maintain &gt;&nbsp;Build</h2>
<p>Maintaining any codebase is way harder than making it. Waaaaaay&nbsp;harder.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been presiding over a rewrite of my own toolset - one that is only 2.5 years or so of my own work - and I&#8217;m amazed and appalled at how crufty it is. Lots of important things are held together with spit and bailing wire. Lots of trivial things are massively over-engineered. And &#8212; though I pride myself on being good about code reuse, _there&#8217;s-only-one-way-to-do-it, _and extending earlier solutions instead of reinventing things &#8212; it&#8217;s full of pointless&nbsp;duplication.   </p>
<p>And even though it&#8217;s 90% my own work it&#8217;s full of conflicting style choices and paradigms.  I guess it shows I&#8217;m still learning, so I haven&#8217;t gotten totally stale&nbsp;yet.  </p>
<h2>#2: Dynamic &gt;&nbsp;Static</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been looking a lot at possible language alternatives to Python for future tools. I love Python. I mean, in a totally unhealthy, creepy, even stalker-y way. But I don&#8217;t like being to beholden to any one tech or approach. I&#8217;d love to get beyond Python&#8217;s erratic distribution mechanisms, and Id&#8217; <em>really</em> like to get my hands on a decent <span class="caps">GUI</span> toolkit that didn&#8217;t make me program C++ indirectly ( <a href="http://shoesrb.com/">Python Shoes</a>, where are&nbsp;you?)  </p>
<p>So, while tinkering with <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a>, <a href="http://cobra-language.com/">Cobra</a>, <a href="http://nimrod-lang.org/documentation.html">Nimrod </a>and a few other options I&#8217;ve been revisiting the old theological debate about dynamic vs static languages; working on <a href="http://moonrise-game.com/">Moonrise </a> (in Unity) has made me realise that C# was designed with the express intention of driving me insane. It seems routinely true that I write 4 times as many lines of C# as I do in Python. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m saving a few bugs because of all the clunky type management stuff, but I think I&#8217;d rather just fix the bugs than suffer through the oceans of boilerplate that C#&nbsp;induces.   </p>
<p>To be fair, it&#8217;s a little worse in Unity than in the rest of the world: you can do a lot to make C# suck less using attributes and reflection and other meta-techniques, but those are tougher to do in Unity&#8217;s special flavor of&nbsp;C#.   </p>
<p>Still, I think I&#8217;ve finally made up my mind on this one: I&#8217;d rather take the risks that come with dynamic code over the sheer, mind-numbing boredom that comes with obsessive type safety.  Especially in a world where overhauling and updating and refactoring code is the <em>real</em> work: building it is just the first&nbsp;chapter.  </p>
<h2>#3 I hate curly&nbsp;braces.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not even trying to deny it anymore. I hate the little bastards.  What a waste of&nbsp;space.  </p>
<h2>#4  I&#8217;m&nbsp;Screwed</h2>
<p>The interesting problem - if I end up just getting cozy with my prejudices and preferences - is now how to pick a decent dynamic environment for tools development while (A) not having the code base degenerate into mush and  (B) having decent <span class="caps">GUI</span> options.   And if at all possible, (C), no goddam curly&nbsp;brackets.  </p>
<p>For most of my work - managing files, talking to databases, and dealing with data on disk performance is not really the most important problem: I tend to deal in minute-scale problems not hour-scale problems, so cutting them down by a factor of 5 is a nice plus rather than a live-or-die necessity.  While this means a bit more freedom, it also removes a sorting criterion from the&nbsp;problem.  </p>
<p>The stinky part is that, for the given problem set there really is <strong>no obvious winner</strong>.  </p>
<ul>
<li>I could imagine that the combination of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby </a>and <a href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a> would be super productive, even though the Shoes <span class="caps">GUI</span> is pretty limited compared to <span class="caps">QT</span> or <span class="caps">WPF</span>.  I could probably tolerate those block ending markers in Ruby, and there is a good set of standard library code out there. The perf is not great but that&#8217;s my least important problem. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s much easier to distribute Ruby apps to users than it is to do with Python,&nbsp;however.</li>
<li>Nimrod looks like a cool little language, but has no equivalent of the Python&nbsp;standardlib.</li>
<li>
<p>Boo and Cobra both use the same <span class="caps">CLR</span> as C#, so theoretically you can use them to drive <span class="caps">GUI</span> apps with <span class="caps">WPF</span> or winforms, but that puts you right back into programming a clunky language through the medium of a nicer one: if I wanted that I&#8217;d stick with&nbsp;PyQT.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Javascript is actually super powerful, in the sense that has the same kind of high level fluidity that Python does. It&#8217;s also got the best (or at least the most broadly available and flexible) <span class="caps">GUI</span> out there in the form of  <span class="caps">HTML</span> + <span class="caps">CSS</span>. Unfortunately it&#8217;s got the security sandbox so you need a special infrastructure to do even really mundane stuff like trolling the files on a hard disk &#8212; to say nothing of it&#8217;s famously bad issues with local vs global variables and scoping.  <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> can eleminate a lot of the worst syntactic pain (and the blankety-blank curly brackets) but it&#8217;s hard to maintain code which is written in one language but actually <em>run</em> in another: &#8220;compiles to Javascript&#8221; is pretty cool until you have to actually debug something which is only genetically related to the code you actually <em>wrote.<br />
</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(update 9/3) You can do an <span class="caps">HTML</span> front end for a python app with the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/">Chromium Embedded Framework for python</a>. That actually works pretty well, and lets you keep <span class="caps">JS</span> for the light weight <span class="caps">UI</span> manipulation while passing the heavy lifting off to Python fairly transparently. The only caveat: the day after I discovered this I went to work, installed the Maya 2015 trial &#8212; and promptly found that <em>their</em> shiny new <span class="caps">HTML</span> gui front end had a Javascript error and did not work, thereby preventing me from logging iu to the trial. It&#8217;s the new thing altight, but it&#8217;s not quite there.  And It&#8217;s still a 2-language solution, albeit a nice&nbsp;one.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(update 9/3):  For completeness sake I should mention the combination of Jytron and <span class="caps">AWT</span> or Swing. This works right out of the box - if you have Jython, you have a complete <span class="caps">GUI</span> toolkit with no downloads, installs or DLLs to manage. You can also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16701979/packaging-a-jython-program-in-an-executable-jar">compiile Jython to executables</a>, buit it&#8217;s not a completely transparent process and it seems a bit fiddly. Still, could be an&nbsp;optiom&#8230;.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(ipdate 9/3)::  I&#8217;ve also been experimenting a lot with compiling IronPython to exes using the <span class="caps">IL</span> compiler that comes with IronPython. So far it actually looks pretty good: the exes are smaller than similar Py2Exes or PyInstaller projects and they seem to be less prone to obscure compilation problems too&#8230;. maybe some light at the end of the&nbsp;tunnel?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>_<strong><span class="caps">TLDR</span>: </strong> _There really is nothing that fills the niche of a powerful, flexible language with good <span class="caps">GUI</span> and distribution options right now.&nbsp;Sigh.  </p>
<p>Please, prove me wrong&nbsp;!</p>
