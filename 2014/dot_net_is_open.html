    <p>Courtesy of <a href="https://plus.google.com/116275833090172173559">+Robert Butterworth</a>  comes the news that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx">.Net is now open source</a>.  Future development will be done out of GitHub (!).  Is the timing - on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall - just a&nbsp;coincidence?  </p>
<p>In the short term this probably only means that some projects which have avoided .Net for being closed-source may consider using C# or other .Net languages. Over the medium term it probably presages a 3-6% decline in the use of the dollar sign in derisive online references to Micro$oft.  What&#8217;s most interesting, though, is what it might mean for Unity, which is hard to predict but tantalizing to speculate&nbsp;on.  </p>
<p><a href="http://logomentor.com/logos/dot-net-logo.gif"><img alt="" src="http://logomentor.com/logos/dot-net-logo.gif" /></a></p>
<p>Mono is an impressive effort but it&#8217;s always been rough around the edges (particularly in the supporting toolsets - nothing makes you appreciate Visual Studio like a few hours with MonoDevelop!  Since <span class="caps">MS</span> picked up SyntaxTree and made <a href="http://unityvs.com/">UnityVS</a> available to all, the editor situation has been a lot better. But the guesswork around different DotNet subsets (and some general wonkiness in the deep-down internals of building big Unity projects) is a blemish on Unity&#8217;s otherwise nicely polished cross-platform&nbsp;credentials.   </p>
<p>A lot of the reason for that is that Mono was developed in a &#8216;clean room&#8217; - for legal reasons neither the Mono team nor the <span class="caps">MS</span> .Net team were allowed to actually look at each other&#8217;s code. It&#8217;s quite impressive that the result works as well as it does. but throwing open the curtains has got to have some benefits as we move forward.  It&#8217;s particularly cool that the .Net tean are actually working with de Izcaza and Xamarin on creating future cross-platform&nbsp;implementations,  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s even possible that this will benefit Maya, by making it possible to do a full-stack .Net port for Maya&#8217;s running on Linux and <span class="caps">OSX</span>.  And maybe, just maybe, this might make things better for the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/trypython/">Silverlight IronPython web tech</a>, which would be pretty cool, given the lame state of <a href="http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2013/12/python-in-browsers.html">Python in the browser</a>.  </p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to see how any of these things will really play out. It&#8217;s not like no big company has ever &#8220;Open-Sourced&#8221; something before as a <span class="caps">PR</span> friendly way of ending support for it. But it&#8217;s always more fun to be an&nbsp;optimist.  </p>
<p>Interesting side note: even <em>they</em> don&#8217;t use <span class="caps">TFS</span> for version control. See, optimism is sometimes justified - every tyranny falls some&nbsp;day.  </p>
