WORK IN PROGRESS
===========

I'm reworking this page right now as I transition over to [MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io) -- which, I should say, is awesome.  So, right now this is pretty much placeholder (the nav bar is pretty rudimentary, for example)

The main item here at the moment is the [Character Riggers' Cookbook](cookbook/index.md) slide deck from GDC.

In the meantime, you might find something useful on my [blog](http://blog.theodox.com)
