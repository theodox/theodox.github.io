WORK IN PROGRESS
===========

I'm reworking this page right now as I transition over to [MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io) -- which, I should say, is awesome.  So, right now this is pretty much placeholder (the nav bar does not work yet either).

Eventually this site will host some [unity course notes](pages/introduction-to-game-development-with-unity.md) and also the [character riggers cookbook](http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/columns/events/gdc2006/articlee9d2.html?id=655) slides.
