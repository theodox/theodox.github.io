</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>While an interesting tactical proposition, this question misses an important point.  The Covenant has already met the Empire; indeed, the whole of Covenant culture is nothing but a kind of cargo-cult effort to reconstitute the Empire.</p>
<p>Because the Empire is just what the Covenant know as the Forerunners.  If the two cultures met in person, it would be via <em>time-travel</em>. </p>
<p>We already know that the Forerunners are the ancestors of modern humans -- that's why John-117 can access the Halo devices. And we know that the empire is, as the saying has it, a powerful galactic civilization from "A long time ago" which spread itself across uncounted lightyears: precisely the sort of thing which, millennia later, would become basis for the Covenant's superstitious worship of the Empire's remnants. Let's consider the xeno-archaeological evidence, by comparing our Imperial legends and records with those of the Covenant's extensive, multi-system search for Forerunner... that is, Imperial... relics.</p>
<p>Go Big Or Go Home</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Forerunner aesthetics, which finds its obvious match in the Empire's notorious fondness for expensive public works mega-projects, is <em>gigantism</em>.  Both the Empire and Forerunners alike possess incredibly advanced technologies; but rather than devoting their considerable talents to things like hand-held personal communications devices or nano-technology both cultures prefer to indulge in projects on a superhuman scale, from mile-high megacities to entire artificial planetoids and ringworlds.  </p>
<p>http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130215044513/starwars/images/c/c7/Senate_District_ROTS.png</p>
<p><em>Coruscant</em> (above) and <em>The Library</em> (below) both demonstrate the same taste for architectural bombast - and for avoiding effecient, inexpensive rectinilear shapes.</p>
<p>http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091210085932/halo/images/9/99/Delta_library.png</p>
<p>When cultures with force-fields and tractor beams remain committed to building enormous mechanical doors, some non-engineering factor is clearly at work. This has led some students to conclude that the Fore-Imperials evolved on a high gravity planet where massive over-engineering was a survival trait. In our records they clearly inhabit Earth-like worlds but their atavistic obsession with size may reflect a more Jovian origin.  </p>
<p>Or, they may just be, you know,  <em>overcompensating</em> for something.  Both Imperial and Forerunner sites display an fondness for unsupported, cantilevered platforms rather than sane, well buttresed structures: a <em>jeu d'esprit</em> of a heavy-world culture that enjoys flaunting its victories over mere gravity in a somewhat tactless (and expensive) fashion:</p>

<p>http://www.niubniubsuniverse.com/References/PicsE1/Coruscant/LandPlatform/Platform_RefDVD_Pics/RefLanding_WideView.jpg</p>
<p>You don't build like that unless you're trying to make a point.</p>
<p>Angles, Angles everywhere</p>
<p>On a related note, it's clear that both the empire and the Forerruners display an equally irrational aversion to right angles: doorways and windowsills in both cultures are almost always trapezoidal or hexagonal, where most cultures would be content with a plain old rectangle:</p>
<p>http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120110005354/starwars/images/d/da/Executorbridge.jpg</p>
<p>http://www.bosoldworld.net/M40_12.jpg</p>
<p>This supports the theory that the Imperial humanoids originated on a high gravity planet where the extra support was useful. However it might also support the overcompensation theory as well, reflecting as it does an exaggerated form of 'manspreading.'  In either case, however, this is another strong parallel demonstrating that the Empire was, in fact, the Forerunner culture.</p>
<p>Blue Horizon</p>
<p>Another important clue is the fact that known Forerunner sites -- and most recorded instances of Imperial interiors -- share the same color palette. The monochromatic interiors combined with cool blue-tinged lighting can hardly be a coincidence.  Most known species see better at the red end of the visible light spectrum, but the Forerunners and the Imperials both seem to prefer their work environments heavily shifted towards the blue - perhaps a reflection of a gravitational blueshift on their massive planet of origin.</p>

<p>This may also accout for the puzzling lack of signage in both sets of installations:  where most military and transportation infrastructure is crawling with text ("NO STEP", "HARD HATS MUST BE WORK AT ALL TIMES", "300 DAYS SINCE LAST DEATH STAR WAS OBLITERATED") both Forerunner and Imperial sites seem strangely bare to us: acres and acres of gigantic walls with nary a name-plate or directions to the nearest restroom. However it's possible that their signage is shifted farther into the blue end of the spectrum than we can easily see: this may be a military readiness technique similar to the use of red lighting on submarines.</p>
<p>But Wait! There's More!</p>
<p>And here's a grab-bag of other Forerunner/Imperial traits:</p>
<p>Floating ball-shaped robots of dubious moral character:</p>

<p>Improbable walking fortresses (the Scarab, of course, being scavenged technology):</p>

<p>http://www.sowhowins.com//Character%20Pictures/Jango%20Fett.jpg</p>
<p>Finally, the clincher: the Empire and the Forerrunners share a remarkable -- indeed, a nearly <em>unique</em> cultural trait.  Alone among starfaring civilizations these two galaxy-spanning civilizations manage to conquer space without ever inventing the <em>handrail</em>, an elementary technology known to every other sentient species.  </p>
<p>Opinion among xeno-archeologists is divided as to the reasons.  It may be some kind of primitives superstition (perhaps the Gods are expected simply seize anyone unwary enought to linger by the side of 5,000 meter deep airshaft) or it may represent a quirk of evolutionary biology.  It's possible the Forerunner/Imperials race possessed the same sort of inner ears as lemurs, rendering a 50 story drop so unthinkable that they felt no more need to guard against it than we feel the need to put up signs reminding people to breathe.  In any event, this is an evolutionarily unusual trait which strongly supports the Empire &gt; Forerunner hypothesis.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>The most potent objection to the Empire / Forerunner hypothesis is the somewhat non-human appearance of the Didact, the only living representative of the Forerunners:</p>
<p>http://41.media.tumblr.com/fefed899f4ecf09464096a76148beefc/tumblr_mg9z82kGpn1ruuqu6o1_1280.jpg</p>
<p>However there are two things to keep in mind. First, there is a considerable time elapsed between our knowledge of the Empire and the creation of the Halo's: millenia may intervene between the paltry planet-killing power of the Death Star and the ultimate Doomsday weapon, the Halos.  So it's possible that the race continued to evolve. However its equally likely that Didact's appearance owes more to the vicissitudes of life as a warrior.  Terrible things happen in space:</p>

<p>In conclusion, and to answer (at last) the original poster's question:
the Covenant -- whose entire culture, after all, is based on the veneration of Forerunner relics -- would be able to put these clues together as easily as I have. The realization would of course come as a terrible shock (as did the realization that the Forerunner technoologies of the Halos responded to human DNA but not to their own).  The difference is that the vision of living, functionioning Forerruner tech -- such as the appearance of a Super Star Destroyer in all its ineffable majesty, rather than crude little boxes like the <em>Pillar of Autumn</em> -- would force them to confront the truth far more quickly than they did in the Halo series. </p>
