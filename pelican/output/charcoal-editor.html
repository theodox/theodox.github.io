  <div class="article_text">
    <p>When you’re shopping around for something new – whether it’s a cool new piece
of software or just a kitchen gadget – it’s not uncommon to tell yourself,
“man, I wish I had thought of that.” But what’s really impressive is when you
see a polished product and you say to yourself <em>Dammnit, I absolutely thought of that!</em>, or <em>I’ve been wanting this exact thing for years!</em>. It’s a rare
thrill when you stumble across something that seems as if it were a gift from
some future self, come back to give you exactly what you wanted in a way that
only you, yourself could.  </p>
<p>One of my coworkers found one of those little somethings the other day - a
product that will make pretty much any TA go feel like Christmas came a little
early.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://zurbrigg.com/charcoal-editor">Charcoal Editor</a> from <a href="http://zurbrigg.com/about">Chris Zurbrigg</a> is a slick, polished replacement for
Maya’s script editor. It’s a plugin (available for Maya on Mac, Windows and
Linux) that offers many of the features of a slick Python IDE right inside of
Maya. Some of the key highlights include  </p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighing</li>
<li>Autcomplete (including your own code and also the entire Maya cmds api)</li>
<li>Smart indent and dedent</li>
<li>Bracket matching</li>
</ul>
<p>but the feature that will sell most Maya veterans instantly is the fact you
can execute lines or scripts without the familiar <strong>Select &gt; Enter</strong> that
has deleted countless lines of your test code down the ages.  </p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/89196374" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>That one feature alone would probably be worth the price for most people who
do a lot of scripting. But the whole package is thoughtfully put together in a
way that clearly says the author wrote a tool for himself – and that he shares
a lot of the frustrations that have driven you and I bonkers for the last 18
years of Maya history. A great example is the addition of quick help for Maya
commands: if you (like me) can never remember the difference between the flags
for <code>listConnections</code> and those for <code>listRelatives</code>, Charcaol allows you to
pop up a quick in-window help view or to open the relevant documentation in a
browser: a welcome alternative to the maddening ritual of entering
“cmds.whatever” into Chrome and being directed to the Maya 2011 Japanese docs
by the mysterious imps of the internet.  </p>
<p>In general, Charcoal shows a lot of attention to the nuances of scripting
work. For example, it allows you to quickly toggle layouts: Charcoal allows
you to quickly flip back and forth between the usual split view and a full
panel of either script or history, so you don’t have to give up coding space
to see your printouts or vice-versa. Likewise, you can set font sizes and
color schemes for the scripting panel and the history panel separately – a big
help if you want to save space on your printouts or if (like me) your eyes are
going and you need to bump up the font size for coding. The history panel even
supports highlighting – separating errors and warnings clearly from regular
printouts, for example. All in all it’s a collection of small touches that
offers a much-appreciated sense that the program has your back and that the
author has wrestled with many of the same irritations you’ve had.  </p>
<p>The product also ventures into territory that’s useally associated with full-
fledged IDEs. It particular it offers an “outline view” which displays the
classes and functions in the current scope - a big help for navigating around
in a longish file, as well as a handy way to remember what you’re working
with. There’s also a “project view” which displays all of the scripts in a
project folder tree – more or less the same as the project views in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> (two other
scripter-friendly editors you should check out if you’ve never seen them.)<br />
These IDE features will be very helpful for folks who’ve been soldiering on
with nothing but the Maya script editor and Notepad. If you’re already using
an IDE like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>,
<a href="https://wingware.com/">Wing</a>, or <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/">PTVS</a>
they may not be quite enough to wean you out of your fancy environment –
particularly if you’r gotten used to using a real debugger instead of
littering your code with print statements. Charcoal’s project features are
functional but – given the nature of the task and the audience – are not as
fancy as the equivalent features in big budget development environments. If
you really prize the ablity to inifitely noodle on color themes, or a built-in
style guide, you may find yourself wandering back to one of the bigger
packages. That’s not a knock on Charcoal, though – it’s just a reminder that
it’s a specialist tool for Maya users and not a general-purpose project
management powerhouse.  </p>
<p>For myself, I plan on sticking with PyCharm for long coding sessions (btw,
PyCharm fans, you’ll be <em>incredibly</em> pleased to hear that Charcoal allows cut
and paste directly from PyCharm, unlike Maya’s wonky script editor. Whoop-de-
doo!) However Charcoal more than justifies itself as a replacement for the
vanilla script editor with a lot of juicy productivity features. I’ve already
gotten a lot of productivity bounce by using <a href="https://github.com/cmcpasserby/MayaCharm">MayaCharm</a> to bypass the Maya script editor whenever possible – but I still spend quite a lot of time in the clunky old Maya pane nonetheless. I’ve got high hopes that Charcoal will save precious brain power for real problems and allow me to focus more on doing my job and less on frantically hitting Undo after my last attempt to execute a line accidentally erased an hour’s work.  </p>

<p>Charcoal offers a free, non-saving demo; an individual license is $49 US (site licenses are available but you’ll have to negotiate them with the author).</p>
