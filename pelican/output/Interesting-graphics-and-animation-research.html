    <p>This page is a list of interesting,  maybe not-quite-ready-real time graphics and animation tech that I'm keeping an eye on. Should be growing over time.  </p>
<h4>Rendering</h4>
<p>Anybody in games should be interested in the fate of <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a>, the no-uvs, variable resolution texturing system from Disney and used in, for example, <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/mari/">Mari</a>.  So far, it's not ready for runtime graphics. but <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gamedev/docs/Borderless%20Ptex.pdf">this Nvidia slideset</a> discusses a realtime implementation.  It claims to be only 15% slower than a UV mapped alternative - while saving about 18% of texture memory.  I'll believe it when I see it, but i <em>want</em> to believe. ( <strong>Update: </strong><em>I went over this with our residence graphics genius and he doesn't think it'll fly, even on XBone / PS4 class hardware)</em>  </p>
<p>A <a href="http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/PE/VMV/VMV12/063-070.pdf.abstract.pdf;internal&amp;action=action.digitallibrary.ShowPaperAbstract">GPU Gem</a> on doing hardware aging of materials using GPU particles. Can't wait to see this get out from behind the paywall!  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/joint-importance-sampling/">Joint Importance Sampling</a>: a paper from Disney on a better way to render path-traced media like fog or water.  Claims to increase render times 1000x for little change in quality! And it's <em>still</em> too slow for games :)  </p>
<p>A <a href="http://ppsloan.org/publications/mrtSA.pdf">new(ish) paper</a> from <a href="http://ppsloan.org/">Peter-Pike Sloan</a> proposing a method for low-res, realtime friendly pseudo gi lighting.  The new hardware generation is not going to make realtime GI happen with <a href="http://cg.ibds.kit.edu/publications/p2011/DGIWTCLPV_Kaplanyan_2011/DGIWTCLPV_Kaplanyan_2011.html">the current techniques,</a> so new ways of looking at GI are important.  </p>
<p>Also from PPS and Bungie, a review of the <a href="http://ppsloan.org/publications/BungieBake.pdf">hardware-based AO bake system used on Destiny</a>.  Note that in this example "AO" is "ambient obscurance" rather than "ambient occlusion" - obscurance accounts for distance to light sources, where as tradtional occlusion is dimensionless.  </p>
<p>A neat paper from Sebastian Lagarde on <a href="http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/observe-rainy-world/">rendering wet surfaces in a physically based environment</a>.  <a href="http://seblagarde.wordpress.com/">Seb's blog</a> is a top-notch reference for anybody doing Physically based rendering (which means most of us by about 2015)  </p>
<h4>Animation</h4>
<p><a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/motion-fields/motion-fields.pdf">Motion fields</a>  "Motion graphs" - basically efficiently seaming together  a desired set of Mocap data  - has been a big deal in academia for a long time, but it's never caught on in games due to the Prince of Persia problem: it's too realistic and thus not responsive enough. This work from the graphics group at UW is an interesting slant on making this more reactive.  Unfortunately @ZoranPopovic has largely moved on to education from animation, but his <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/">group's page at UW </a>has a lot of interesting work from the last 5-6 years.  </p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of Kevin Wampler's work on procededural animation. <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/">This paper</a> from 2009 describes a (slow, offline, but _cool) _process for generating decent gaits for arbitrarily shaped creatures. Check out the <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/movs/morphology.avi">videos</a> (note: big download, requires divx).  <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~geijt101/papers/SA2013/">This one</a> from the Netherlands is a similar optimization based approach to bipeds only - the big wrinkle being that everything in this one runs on simulated muscle networks rather than pure joint motors. Fun stuff!  </p>
<p>This is an <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jtan34/project/softBodyLocomotion.html">interesting paper from Karen Liu's group at Georgia Tech</a>, featuring soft body simulation done with a combination of finite element modeling and a muscle fiber system. Soft body animation remains a pretty black art, it would be great if it catches on in realtime-friendly ways. Not holding my breath, alas.</p>
<p><a href="http://aigamedev.com/open/access/overgrowth/">This talk from the developer of Overgrowh </a>is an interesting look at hybrid physical-kinematic animations, a sort of  'Euphoria Lite'.  Some related references from <a href="http://aigamedev.com/open/editorial/animation-revolution/">AIGameDev</a>.  Also related is <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/search.php#&amp;category=free&amp;firstfocus=&amp;keyword=lico&amp;conference_id=">Rick Lico's talk from GDC 2014</a> about the Destiny animation system (GDC vault paywall).  </p>
<h4>Procedural worlds</h4>
<p>I'm very interested in procedural worlds for <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/16/4-hours-in-state-of-decays-open-world-zombie-nightmare">obvious reasons</a>.  It's an area that's got enornous potential but has been moving very slowly in the game side of things.  </p>
<p><a href="http://hss.ulb.uni-bonn.de/2013/3124/3124.pdf">The early chapters of this dissertation</a> provides a decent overview of lots of the terminology and existing work in the field  </p>
<p>There's <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine">CityEngine, </a> which looks good if you're looking at city size data sets (and it <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine/features">supports python</a>!)  There are a lot of nice procedural terrain packages but they all look very fractal-y to me  nowadays; it was impressive in <em>Wrath of Khan</em> but hasn't moved on much since. The most interesting terrain paper I've seen in a while is <a href="http://hpcg.purdue.edu/?page=publication&amp;id=170">this one</a>, which uses rivers as the structural basis for terrain generation..  </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cgvlab/urban/urban-procedural-modeling.html">collection of papers from Purdue</a> on procedural land use - thing like zoning and road layout. Some of this looks pretty handy.   If it gets scary, just remember 'markov chain'  is math-speak for 'state machine', more or less.  The other fun aspect is their efforts to  'inverse model' the stuff they study - to turn real data into the data their model uses.  </p>
<h3>Meshes, models, and surfaces</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~keenan/Projects/GloballyOptimalDirectionFields/paper.pdf">This paper from Columbia</a> promises an optimal way of establishing surface flow across arbitrary surfaces. This is interesting for a couple of reasons - it might be an interesting improvement to mesh-based navigation, and it might also lead to alternate methods of automatic UV generation. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/ShefferPraunRose.pdf">decent roundup of mesh parameterization techniques</a></p>
