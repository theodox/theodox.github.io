  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I'm notorious for issuing gloomy pronouncements at GDC and elsewhere about the long term decline in artist pay.  I often point out that my starting salary in 1995 was about what an 6-year veteran makes today.  Maybe I'm just trying to scare the fainthearted out of the business and drive prices back up.  </p>
<p>Still, my complaints are nothing compared to what's been going in the VFX industry.  The latest victim is <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/breaking-dreamworks-animation-will-shut-down-pdidreamworks-studio-over-500-jobs-will-be-eliminated-108161.html">PDI</a>, which will be laying off 500 people.  While games has had it's ups and downs the last few years, VFX has had a brutal time with lots of closures and disruptions.   </p>
<p>In that connection I came across <a href="https://vfxsoldier.wordpress.com/">VFXSoldier </a>, a site which has been fighting for more unionization in the VFX world.  While I'm deeply ambivalent about unionizing in CG -- I don't know if it's really <em>possible,</em> much less a good idea -- but it's certainly not something to dismiss without thinking about and it is hard to see how it could make life worse for the poor VFX folks.  It's a worthwhile read just to see how the other half lives. I'm curious to hear what others think.  </p>
