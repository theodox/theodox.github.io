    <p>Well, another year, another <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a>.  </p>
<p>An upbeat show - the combination of the indie/mobile tidal wave and a new
console generation has breathed some much needed life into the old beast - the
business center was bigger than I've seen it in years, and full of people
hustling.  </p>

<p>The floor was buzzing!  </p>
<p>The absence of many familiar AAA names was still pretty striking - no lines
around the block for the Activision/EA meat markets, no scores of kids waiting
to show their portfolios to someone from Blizzard or whatnot.  </p>
<p>There was, however, a booth from <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>. Someboedy
told me they are <em>hiring tech artists</em>.  See, we're conquering the world...
from above!  </p>
<p>And, there was an amazing bustle of activity from the indie-casual-mobile
side. Tons and tons of booths, more than I remember ever seeing before. Most
of them will probably be gone in two years, but it's still great to see people
hustling around, coming up with plans, and trying to make something big after
all the gloom of the last few years.  Here's hoping the many friends and
former colleagues who've been battered by business can make up some lost
ground in this new gold rush.  It's probably another bubble - remember when
everybody wanted to hire a teal of 800 to talk on WOW? - but it's still better
than sitting around moping.  </p>
<p>All the movement has a lot to do with all the changes in the business that
have broken the stifling rut of AAA juggernauts, sequel-itis, and me-too
design that was hanging over us like a fog a few years back. All sorts of fun
and interesting stuff happening.  </p>
<p>Saw some cool tech too, which I'll talk about later in the week. In the
meantime: so long SF!  </p>
<p>Update: I did not see this talk, but <a href="http://ww
w.gamasutra.com/blogs/GregCostikyan/20140324/213784/2014_GDC_Rant_We_Had_a_Goo
d_10_Years_But_the_Walls_are_Closing_In.php">this rant from Greg Costikyan</a> does summarize neatly some things
I am worrying about over the long haul...  </p>
