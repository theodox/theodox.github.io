Summary: pending

Since the demise of the late, lamented [Game Developer Magazine](http://www.gdcvault.com/gdmag), I've been wondering if it's time to find some other writing outlet. Most of my spare writing energy for last year was consumed by shipping [State Of Decay](http://undeadlabs.com/about-state-of-decay/) and working on a book project for Focal Press.  


  


Now that both of those are safely in the past I'm going to spend a few weeks noodling on this to see if it's congenial.  I'm working on another book outline at the moment, and as topics of interest come up - or as I need to think out loud about them - i'll try floating them here to see how they look in print.  I also plan on ruminating on knotty tech-art questions, programming problems, and maybe throwing in the occasional classical allusion to make myself look smart.  


  


No cat pictures though.  Not my bag.
