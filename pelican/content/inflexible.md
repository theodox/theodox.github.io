"Inflexbility" might be the right concept - but the time scale is rather different.  The Senate's fatal failure was not in 69, or 49, but in 133.

Caesar and the Senate
=====================

It's true that the final crisis of the Republic was deliberately provoked by the conservative (or, if you prefer, _reactionary_) faction in the Senate, particularly by Cato and his allies.  Caesar's recall from Gaul was not just a routine Senatorial decree -- it was intended to force Caesar out of political life (or out of life altogether -- though the most likely precedent was the comfortable exile of other overly ambitious politicians like [Verres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verres)  and [Publius Cornelius Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Sulla)). The reactionaries knew full well that they were risking a civil war by removing Caesar's official immunity and summoning home to face a highly politicized trial, and during the months leading up to the final rupture the majority of Senators pleaded in vain for some kind of deal to avoid the final reckoning.

However that was not inflexibility: it was desperation.  The struggle to save the Republic was already lost before Caesar marched off to Gaul.  The plot against Caesar was not an effort to _save_ the Republic: it was a last-ditch gamble to _restore_ it. The Roman constitution -- such as it was -- had been basically abrogated for a decade at that point.  From 59 to 49 the [first triumivirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate) owned Roman politics.  This was not just an informal power-sharing deal between Caesar, Pompey and Crassus: it involved organized political violence and the threat of worse:  Here, for example, in Plutarch's description of the aftermath of the [Lucca Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucca_Conference) in 56 BC where Caesar, Crassus and Pompey reorganized their racket:

> When, Pompey and Crassus openly announced their candidature, the rest [of the candidates] took fright and withdrew from the contest; but Cato encouraged Domitius, who was a kinsman and friend of his, to proceed, urging and inciting him to cling to his hopes, assured that he would do battle for the common freedom. For it was not the consulate, he said, which Crassus and Pompey wanted, but a tyranny, nor did their course of action mean simply a canvass for office, but rather a seizure of provinces and armies.
> With such words and such sentiments Cato all but forced Domitius to go down into the forum as a candidate, and many joined their party. Many, too, voiced their amazement thus: "Why, pray, should these men want a second consulship? And why once more together? Why not have other colleagues? Surely there are many men among us who are not unworthy to be colleagues of Pompey and Crassus!"
> Alarmed at this, the partizans of Crassus and Pompey abstained from no disorder or violence, however extreme, and capped the climax by waylaying Domitius, as he was coming down into the forum before day-break with his followers, killing his torch-bearer, and wounding many, among whom was Cato.
> After routing their opponents and shutting them up at home, they had themselves proclaimed consuls and a short time afterwards they once more surrounded the rostra with armed men, cast Cato out of the forum, slew several who made resistance, and then had another five years added to the proconsulship of Caesar in Gaul, and the provinces of Syria and both Spains voted to themselves. When the lot was cast, Syria fell to Crassus, and the Spains to Pompey.
Plutarch *Crassus*, 15.

The triumvirs also allowed [Clodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher) to organize routine political violence against their opponents in the city, up to and including murder.  

The key levers of power were effectively monopolized by the triumvirs and their armed supporters. While elections continued and the Senate debated, nothing of consequence could happen without the say-so of the triumvirs.  It wasn't exactly a police-state or dictatorship -- it was perhaps more like classic Chicago-style machine politics where the forms of representative government swirled peripherally around a solid core of insider deals, topped off with a mob violence when needed.

The view that Caesar was an FDR-style progressive who wanted to save the Republic from itself is pretty hard to maintain when one recalls that for more than a decade he and his allies could do _anything they wanted_, stomping on precedent and the tradition without hesitation. What the record shows is that what they wanted was lucrative military commands for themselves and payoffs -- in the form of land grants and money -- for their soldiers.  He was a 'reformer' in the [Richard J. Daley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Daley) mold at best: reform for me and my friends.  

The final crisis of 49 BC was precipitated by  Crassus' death at [Carrhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carrhae) in 53, which turned a relatively stable triumvirate into an unstable duo. Caesar's outsize success in Gaul was clearly threatening Pompey's pre-eminence, so  Cato and his allies in the Senate hoped to manipulate Pompey (who they otherwise despised as another military adventurer) into breaking the alliance which had basically privatized the Republic for 15 years. Their hope -- forlorn, as it turned out -- was that the two dynasts would weaken each other and allow the traditional elites to reassert their power. This was more or less the same strategy that many of the survivors of this civil war would try again in the 30's, when Octavian turned up to challenge Marc Anthony's stranglehold over the (briefly) restored Republic.  

It didn't work in 49 against Caesar or in 43 against Antony. The traditional elites were helpless in the face of military dynasts. 

This was a fact which had been looming larger and larger since the days of Marius.  The *auctoritas* of the Senate, the majesty of the law, and even the money of the upper classes meant nothing in the face of professional armies who cared more for their generals than for existing Roman state. 

FDR? Mussolini? Daley?
===========================

The 'progressive Caesar' and the 'reactionary Senate' are characters from one very particular reading of this period. The problem is, it's very difficult (particularly at two millenia's remove) to tell the difference between a historical struggle and a faction fight.  Politicians lie about their real motives all the time -- but at the same time they are bound by their public positions; a pair of facts which confound both the ideologues and the cynic. Politics is venal and idealistic at the same time.  Judging by his words Caesar was a reformist moderate -- but judging by his words alone, so were most of the _optimates_: Cicero, Pompey and even Cato can sound reasonable.  

Caesar definitely cloaked himself in the _[popularis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares)_ tradition of Marius (and before him, of the Gracchi).  But what that means in practice is hard to pin down. Much of the most 'social' legislation of the period really belongs not to Caesar but to Clodius -- whom Caesar often had When Caesar or Pompey (or, for that matter, Marius and Sulla) want land for their veterans are they 'really' trying to protect the dispossessed against the plutocrats? Or are they 'really'  paying off the armed forces that will guarantee their own power and position? One thing is certain: loyal armed supporters were the most precious commodity of late Republican politics. Ultimately Augustus outlasted all his rivals because he could build on the inherited loyalty of Caesar's veterans, who followed him even when he was a obscure relative suddenly made heir to Caesar's name.   The same question mark hangs over the soldiers themselves -- were they loyal clients of the house of Julius? Mercenaries with an eye for the biggest payout? Or a political faction in their own right who seized on a convenient figure-head to advance their own agenda?

To a very important degree it really is the attitudes of the soldiers -- and the calculations of the politician/generals who relied on them -- that is _the only_ issue here: the last war of the Republic was also the  war in which private armies came to replace Rome's civilian government forever.

Inflexiblity
=============

The rise of the private armies does, in fact, have a lot to do with reactionary inflexibility: not Cato's but [Scipio Nasica's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_Nasica_Serapio_(consul_138_BC)).  The historical challenge that the Senate failed to meet wasn't the challenge of Caesar: it was the challenge of [the Gracchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi).  

Roman victory in the second Punic War, followed by the conquest of the Po valley and the rapid assertion of Roman hegemony throughout the Mediterranean in the generation after [Zama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zama) upended the social basis of Italy. Untold wealth poured into Rome (and Italy as a whole) but it wasn't shared out equally.  The small farmers who formed the backbone of the Roman army and state in the third century BC were increasingly dispossessed in the second: some were war refugees forced into cities; some could not keep up their farms as they campaigned for longer and longer durations outside of Italy; and many lost out to _latifundia_, industrial scale farms bought with the profits of war and staffed by the massive number of slaves that the wars created.

The net result was, to a significant degree, the loss of the center: the Roman 'middle class' of smallholders shrank and the urban proletariat -- poorer and only loosely connected to the institutions and traditions of the state -- grew. [Gaius Gracchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Gracchus) and his brother [Tiberius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus) tried, int the 130's BC, to stem this development with a populist programme of land reform, intended to reverse the drift away from Rome's agrarian roots. 

They were murdered for it.  

Their opponents claimed they were using populist proposals to make themselves tyrants; their supporters pointed out that their murderers had huge financial stakes in the land which the Gracci proposed to redistribute. In this case it doesn't matter if the Gracchi were sincere reformers or populist rabble-rousers aiming at tyranny (which was, of course, what their opponents believed).  The problem they articulated was real, and the Senate failed to address it constructively while they were alive or after their deaths.  

The murder of Gaius Grachus in 133 -- by a mob of Senators led by the sitting _pontifex maximus_, no less --  was a double tragedy. It was the first open political murder in Rome for centuries.  And, it  guaranteed that nothing would be done to stop the proletarianization of Italy and the rise of the military dynasts. With fewer and fewer opportunities in civilian life, more and more Romans drifted into the professional military where your general was your patron -- the source of your wealth and the guarantor of your retirement.  The Roman state was just an abstraction. Marius and Sulla, Caeasar, Pompey, Antony,  Octavian, and everyone ever plopped onto the throne by the Praetorians all owe their careers to the Nasica the reactionary: the man who killed both Gaius Gracchus and the Roman Republic.
