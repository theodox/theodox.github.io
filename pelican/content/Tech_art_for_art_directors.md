Summary: The slides for my 2015 GDC talk, [Technical Art For Art Directors](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art) are available on the GDC Vault

I see that the slides from my 2015 GDC talk, _Technical Art For Art Directors_ is now up on the [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art). **paywall warning** Enjoy – and feedback in the comments is very welcome. I can post the slides if there is interest, but if you watch the video you’ll see that they don’t really work without the verbal context. I defy anybody who wasn't there to make sense of this image, for example....

I’ll say in passing that – despite the lack of text in the finished presentation – I had great luck putting this talk together in [Markdown](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2015/03/markdown-wrapup.html) using [DeckSet](http://www.decksetapp.com/), which let me do the first 90% of the presentation without ever opening PowerPoint or Keynote. The slides were just one big plain text file, which let me [put them up on github](https://github.com/theodox/tadwtf/blob/master/tadwtf_slides.md) so I could version them and track changes without getting bogged down in the finicky formatting nonsense that ultimately consumes all slide decks. I particularly liked this workflow because I could work as if it was text but still run it as a slide show very early on, which gave me a chance to get my patter down and listen to the words instead of getting hung up on formatting text. **Plain text FTW!**
