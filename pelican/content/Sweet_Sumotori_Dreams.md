If you're not familiar with Sumotori Dreams, it's the funniest thing that ever happened to procedual animation.  Proof here (loud cackling and some profanity in the audio track, could not find any that did not have lots of hilarity and shouting):  
  


  


  
If you're at all interested in [procedural animation](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/p/interesting-graphics-and-animation.html) \- or have even a tiny sliver of a sense of humor - you should buy the [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sumotori-dreams/id838455884?ls=1&mt=8) the [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gravitysensation.sumotori), or the [PC version](http://www.gravitysensation.com/sumotori/Sumotori_Full___Setup.exe).
