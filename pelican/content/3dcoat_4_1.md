Summary: 3DCoat, an interesting voxel based ZBrush alternative.

  
Version 4.1 of 3DCoat just came out - details in the video above or at [3D-Coat.com](http://3d-coat.com/).  
  
3DCoat is an interesting voxel-based alternative to Zbrush. It deserves a lot of credit for really pushing the retopology business forward, and also for early PTex support. The interface is less idiosyncratic than Zbrush's but less by-the-numbers than Mudbox.  
  
Plus, it's made in Kiev - buy a copy and [stand up for Ukrainian independence](http://www.artistssupportukraine.com/)!
