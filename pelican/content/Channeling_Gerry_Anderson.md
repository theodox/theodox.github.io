Summary: pending

Utterly off topic.  And brilliant.  This guy is totally channeling Gerry Anderson and Derek Meddings of Thunderbirds fame - not only is the home model animation work pretty cool, it's a pitch-perfect reproduction of the original aesthetic right down to the music choices and ponderous VO.
