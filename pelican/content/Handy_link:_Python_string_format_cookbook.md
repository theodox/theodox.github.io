Summary: pending

If you're like me and addicted to using the old-school percent-symbol based string format, the newer bracket-based formatting is probably a bit mysterious. The [python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) certainly don't help, they seem to be written for C programmers on meth (a help document entitled 'string format specification mini language' does not scream 'usability' to me, at any rate).   
  
So, many props to Marcus Kazmierczak for his handy [Python String Formatting Cookbook](http://mkaz.com/2012/10/10/python-string-format/) page. It's already saved me a ton of profanity. Here's to elevating the discourse of the internet!
