Summary: A compendium of truly mind-blowingly bad CG

Anybody who has ever had to suffer through demo reel reviews will appreciate this:  This guy's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Really3D) is the Louvre of bad CG. And yes, he is in on the joke. But he is also [looking for donations](http://www.patreon.com/Really3D) so he can raise enough money for a PC which can render shadows.
