Summary: seeking input for an upcoming talk on technical art at GDC

I'm working a talk for [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) , tentatively entitled "_Technical_ Art Director? What the heck does that mean?"  

I'd love to hear thoughts from all you industry types on what the role means. That could be what you think it means for your company, or what you think it means when other people hear it, or what you think it ought to mean. 

Good anecdotes are particularly appreciated and may be shamelessly stolen :)

So please comment below and let me know what you think while I'm trying to figure out what I think...  
  
PS for future readers coming here via Google or whatnot, [this link goes to my perennial _how to write  a GDC talk_ post](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/08/submit.html). Physician, heal thyself!

**Update**: [Here is the talk as it was finally delivered](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021806/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Technical-Art) at GDC 2015.
