Summary: pending

I've finally gotten around to re-hosting the slides from the [Character Rigger's Cookbook](http://theodox.github.io/#!cookbook/index.md) talk.  You can also get the [original audio on the GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/search.php#&category=free&firstfocus=&keyword=character+rigging%2Bbest%2Bpractices&conference_id=).

For the tiny handfull of you how were using my Unity course notes, I'm in the process of moving them to a new host.  So the old link at _theodox.com_ is no longer correct (if you follow it you'll get a work-in-progress page; I'm experimenting with a cool new [markdown based wiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md) that is much nicer than the old one at [tryscribble.com](http://tryscribble.com/), but I have yet to make 'real' pages).  I'll announce it here when they go live again.  


  
While moving things around I also added redirect so you can find this blog at [blog.theodox.com](http://blog.theodox.com/) as well as the usual blogspot link.
