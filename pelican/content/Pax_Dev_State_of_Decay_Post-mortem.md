I'll be [on a panel this Thursday at Pax Dev,](http://dev.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/state-of-decay-postmortem) along with a bunch of my [+Undead Labs](https://plus.google.com/108326676864227822131)  colleagues to talk about how we shipped a big open world game with a teensy tiny team.  Since we're also debuting [Moonrise ](http://moonrise-game.com/)at the show, and hanging out with [State of Decay](http://undeadlabs.com/about-state-of-decay/) fans as well, it's gonna be a busy, busy week. Hope to see you there!  
  
PS. You know we're looking for some serious senior tech-artists, right?
