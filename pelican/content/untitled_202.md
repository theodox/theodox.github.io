Summary: Oldest of old-school CG from Robert Abel and Associates.

Still on holiday blogging wise, as we ponder the year gone by, give a thought to these ancient nuggets from [Robert Abel](http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/abel.html), back from when I was still in high school :)  Back when being a 'technical artist' probably meant 'being the guy who can hand adjust the laser in the slide-rendering machine that produces our graphics on film'
