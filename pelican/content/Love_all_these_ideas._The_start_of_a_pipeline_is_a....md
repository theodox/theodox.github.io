Love all these ideas. The start of a pipeline is always one of the hardest bits. It's such a chicken/egg conundrum. Eventually, though, you have to have an "installer" that hacks the userSetup.py/.mel to kick off tools. Then it's all about adding the proper python paths in the proper order. Looking forward to the next post.
