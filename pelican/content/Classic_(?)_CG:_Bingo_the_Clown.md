Summary: Chris Landreth's emininently creepy CG short, "Bingo the Clown"

From the Classic CG files comes _Bingo the Clown_. This was originally created to showcase the capabilities of Maya 1.0, back in 1998. It creeped me out then and it creeps me out now.  

*Missing video*

  
I've been told, I don't know how correctly, that [Chris Landreth](http://chrislandreth.com/) \- the animator who did this film - was the driving force between Maya's decision to use Euler angles for everything. I hope that's not true. Having this video and those goddamn Euler angles on your conscience is a lot to answer for.
