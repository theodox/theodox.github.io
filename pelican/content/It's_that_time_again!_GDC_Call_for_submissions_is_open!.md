Summary: The GDC call for submissions 2015 is open

It's time again for GDC speakers to submit their proposals.  TA's have a long history of providing excellent talks at the main conference and at the Tech Art Bootcamp - so take some time to put together a proposal for this year's conference.   
  
For more on why this is a Good Idea<sup>tm</sup>, check out [last year's post on the same topic](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/08/submit.html).  One important note! This year the call for subs closes on August 27, **NOT** August 28 as it is in the linked post !
