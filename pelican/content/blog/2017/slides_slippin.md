Summary: Some issues with the [Character Riggers' Cookbook](pages/cookbook)

A quick heads up: Dropbox, where I'd been hosting the images for the _[Character Riggers' Cookbook](pages/cookbook)_ slides, no longer serves images to HMTL requests -- so the slide images don't show anymore.  I found an online version of an earlier incarnation of the talk (an _Angelfire_ page, if you can believe it!) and am pointing the cookbook link at that for the time being. I'll get the better looking version of the slides rebuilt ASAP.  

If you really need a copy of the presentation I can send the images in a zip -- contact me via the comments.  Sorry for the disruption.
