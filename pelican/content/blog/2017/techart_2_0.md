Summary: Tech-Artists.Org got a facelift!

After several months of behind the scenes work, [Tech-artists.org](http://tech-artists.org/){:target="_blank"} has a new face.

We've moved the site to a cloud-hosted [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) server, replacing our wonky old VBulletin forums with a swanky, mobile-friendly front end.  It's a _much_ more pleasant reading and writing experience, and it uses the same Markdown syntax as [this blog](/2016/new_blog) and GitHub, which makes adding code examples approximately 17 million times easier than the old VBulletin way. 

If you're already a registered user you should check it out. New users are more than welcome (and we've added easy sign-in with either Google or Github credentials).

This is a great time to get involved the tech-art community as we clean up and modernize the site.  Hope to see you there. And, if you've missed out on it, don't forget to join the chatter in the [Tech-artists slack channel](https://tech-artists.slack.com/) too!
