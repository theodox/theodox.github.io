Summary: A handy tool for storing data in your maya files.

TA work is like the game of Telephone. It's about passing information around: getting a bit of content from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible.  Unfortunately it's usually also a buzzing, blooming confusion worthy of the Tower Of Babel.

Getting all of the disparate parts of a pipeline to talk to each other is hard -- between different apps, different languages, and different hands touching different parts of the process a typical "pipeline" looks more like something spawned by an anti-social [Rube Goldberg](https://www.rubegoldberg.com/about/) than a smoothly functioning assembly line.  Important data frequently travels across the studio by a mixture of naming conventions, handshake deals, email threads and half-remembered hallway conversations.

It's usally tough for us to do much about the social and political side of this on our own; but nowadays it's actually quite easy to take a stab at the mere technological side.  Nowadays it is not actually that complex to build tools that can share data fairly well without a big investment in proprietary tech, as long as you think the problem through.  All you really need is a clean, simple way for different parts of the pipeline to share generic data -- a simple language that everything from a simple Python script to a heavy-iron C++ app can work with. 

The ideal glue for cementing your pipeline together needs a couple of obvious characteristics:

1. **Universality** The most important thing you need from a pipeline-wide data format is that it's accessible from a lot of places: it needs to be something you can write from Python and read in C++, for example.
2. **Simplicity** It's critical that a one-size-fits-all data blob isn't over-engineered.  You can't anticipate every performance-sensitive or data formatting problem in advance: the job of a good glue format is simply to pass clear instructions. 
3. **Readability** Eventually something is going to go wrong. The job of figuring out what went wrong will be a lot easier if you don't need anything fancier than a text editor to know what you're seeing.

There are a lot of decent candidates that fit these criteria, and you might legitimately run with any of them.  For my money, though, the easiest and simplest way to go for pipeline glue is [JSON](http://www.json.org/). While it's not the prettiest or the most sophisticated format ever invented, it is simple, flexible, and robust. Above all it's easy to read and write -- you can read and write JSON with nothing more sophisticated than Notepad. There are easily available libraries for it in every language under the sun.  

JSON isn't perfect. If you really need to store very complex data -- particularly hierarchies of objects -- it's kind of cumbersome. For glue-data, though, for all the little bits of stuff that get passed around between different apps and different disciplines.
