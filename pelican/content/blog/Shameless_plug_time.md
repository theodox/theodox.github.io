I'm pleased and of course also nervous.  If you like it, please be sure to leave a positive review on Amazon - I'm told it makes a big difference.  I don't actually make any money from this one (such is modern publishing, alas) but I do have another book under way and it'll be much easier to get that published if this one does well and is well reviewed.
