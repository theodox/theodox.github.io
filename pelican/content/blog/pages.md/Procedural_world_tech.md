Summary: A list of interesting papers and articles related to open world games, procedural world technology, and other big-world related issues.

This page is a very _lightly_ curated list of resource I'm keeping for myself while researching procedural world generation tech.  I'm keeping links here but I'm not commenting (at least not yet) on whether or not they look good, feasible or just plain goofy.  
  
[An paper on on clothoid road curve generation](http://www.tcd.ie/civileng/Staff/Brian.Caulfield/3A1/3A1%20Lecture%2013.pdf) with some good reference numbers.

http://www.world-machine.com/download.php?page=basic is a pretty slick node-based procedural terrain generator. No scatter/foliage etc, but generates very nice heightmaps with neat erosion filters.

http://www.joesfer.com/?p=22  An interesting discussion of procedural weathering.  The particle paint feature in Substance Painter has been really cool, this is in a similar vein
