Summary: Moonrise is live on Steam!

Moonrise is [up on Steam now](http://store.steampowered.com/app/351040/)! It's a blast to see people logging in from all over and playing.

Now that the cat is out of the bag I'll try to post some tech postmortems on the pipeline and some of the interesting shader work we did.  
  
**PS** If you get into the game, I share the username 'Alpha' with my kids.  So try sending friend requests, but if you get turned down it might be the kids instead of me! Don't take it personally.
