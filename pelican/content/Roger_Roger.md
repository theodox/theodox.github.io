Summary: Introducing [standaloneRPC](https://github.com/theodox/standaloneRPC/tree/more-secure), a simple maya module for remotely controlling a maya standalone using JSON over http.

If you've been playing with the [stansdaloneRPC server](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/04/earth-calling-mayastandalone.html), I've [added a new branch to the github](https://github.com/theodox/standaloneRPC/tree/more-secure) project that includes a minimal level of password security. It's _still_ not the kind of security you want if this is to be exposed to the wicked world, but it should suffice to keep you free from teammates who want to prank you.
