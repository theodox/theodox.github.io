Summary: A handy cheat-sheet site for python regexes.

If you hate regexes as much as I do - which, honestly, seems scarcely possible - you should check out these regex preview sites which make like a little easier when you're trying to work out a particularly nasty one:  


### Python: [Pythex](https://pythex.org/) 

### C# / dotnet : [Regex Storm](http://regexstorm.net/tester) 

Both of these offer big productivity boost over the usual tweak-run-check cycle
