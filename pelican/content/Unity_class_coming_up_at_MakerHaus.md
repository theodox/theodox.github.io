Summary: pending

I'll be teaching a Unity class at [MakerHaus](http://www.makerhaus.com/classes/#discipline-digital-media) in Fremont starting January 13th.  This is an intro class but should be useful for anybody who has heard about Unity but doesn't use it professionally and would like to jumpstart the learning process.
