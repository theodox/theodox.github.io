This is the wiki for the MakerHaus class __Introduction to Game Development With Unity__. This is a paper-free version of course notes along with links to important resources and downloadable content.

You'll want to check out [what you'll need to bring](what-you-ll-need). 

The [Course Description](course-description) page covers the basics of what the class is about. The [Course Outline](course-outline) page contains lines to the notes for each week of the 6-week session.  There's also a page of [useful resources](resources--2) which can point you at online documentation and Q/A forums. If you're trying to learn all the buzzwords there's a [glossary](glossary) of common Unity terms

Shared course files are hosted at [this Dropbox page](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/131l92096teyrch/WRH9YI9oyY).
