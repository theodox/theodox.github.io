# GUI Draw Example

1. Download the unity package from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/unity%40makerhaus/week4/SpaceOdyssey.unitypackage)
2. Open it and run it.
3. Now check the **HUD** script.  This script uses GUI.DrawTexture to draw a full screen graphic, and then multiple **GUI.Label** calls to display statistics
4. If you crash the spaceship into the moon, you'll see a different full screen graphic. This is toggled by a switch in the code which is set by another component.
5. Note that the spaceship component uses the same **Input.GetAxis** technique we saw earlier.
6. The technique in this example has two drawbacks
  * The full screen texture is large and takes up a lot of memory, even though it is mostly empty space
  * Scaling a bitmap to fit different monitors never looks as good as a 1-1 pixel scale
  * Use smaller elements that can be positioned relative to the screen, or custom bitmaps for different resolutions
