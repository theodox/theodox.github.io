# Shooting Rays

To get a 3d position you get the ray from the camera and then check it using **[Physics.Raycast](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html)**.

1. Create a new scene.
2. Add a plane (**GameObject >> Create Other > Plane**)
3. Position the main camera so it has a good view of the whole plane (use the **Ctrl+Shift+F** trick if that makes it faster).
4. Create a cube (**GameObject >> Create Other > Cube**)
5. In the project window, create a new script (**Right click > Create > C# Script**). Call it **RayTest**
6. Add it to the cube 
6. Turn the cube's *Collider* off using the checkbox in the inspector. This makes sure that we don't get hits on the cube itself, just the plane.
7. In the Update method:<pre>
Ray test = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay (Input.mousePosition);
RaycastHit hit;
if (Physics.Raycast (test, out hit)) 
    {
    Vector3 targetpos = new Vector3 (hit.point.x, 0.5f, hit.point.z);
    transform.position = targetpos;
    }</pre>
8. Test it in Unity. The cube should follow the mouse around on the surface of the plane.
9 Try tilting the plane and running again. What happens?
10 Change<pre>
 Vector3 targetpos = new Vector3 (hit.point.x, 0.5f, hit.point.z);</pre>
to<pre> Vector3 targetpos = new Vector3 (hit.point.x, hitpoint.y + 0.5f, hit.point.z);</pre> and retry.

Think about how you could use this trick with the goldfish example from last week...
