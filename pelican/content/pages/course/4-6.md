#Excercise: Using Input Axis

1. Create a new scene
2. Add a cube and scale it to 2 units in the Z axis
3. In the project pane, create a new C# script. Call it *BasicInput*
4. Add it to your cube
4. Double click to open
5. Add two float fields:
<pre>
    public float Speed;
    public float TurnSpeed;
</pre>
6. In the Update method, add a line to get the vertical axis:
<pre>
float forward_back = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
transform.position = new Vector3(0, 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical"));
</pre>
7. Save and run. Watch out for squigglies and other errors! (**TIP** *If you see this error at the bottom, make sure 'Vertical' is correctly spelled*)

9. Observe what happens when you press the Up or Down arrow key:  The box will move between +1 and -1 in the Z axis, but it moves smoothly **even though you are setting the transform directly**.
