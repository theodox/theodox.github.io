## 1.4 Adding Physics
Now we're going to test out the ball just to make sure that the game code which uses it works. We'll also learn how to add a [component](glossary#component) to a [gameObject](glossary#gameObject).

1. We'll add a [RigidBody](glossary#rigidbody) component to the ball to make it react to gravity. Select the ball and add the component using **Component > Physics > RigidBody**.
2. In the inspector, set the mass to something like **80**. All Unity physics values are in metric units, so this means the ball ways about 16 pounds.

3. Time for a test! Use the *play* button at the top of the screen (or **Ctrl+P**) to enter play mode.  If all goes well, your ball should drop onto the alley!  Don't worry, when you leave play mode (using the button or **Ctrl+P** again) it will revert to where you put it.  
  > If you want, rotate the alley a little with the rotate tool (**E**) and see what happens. If you do, though, remember to reset the rotations on the alley using the inspector - you don't want your bowling alley to have a slope!
4. We need to add another component that represents the force of a throw. Select the ball and use the **Add Component** button in the inspector window. That will pop up a dialog where you can choose a component to add.  First click on **Physics** to see that category, then scroll down until you find the **ConstantForce** component. Click on it to add it to your ball.
> This is exactly the same as using selecting the ball and using **Component > Physics > ConstantForce**. Use whatever style you prefer - they work the same way.
4. Now we're going to add a custom component of our own. In your project window find the script file **BallThrower.cs**.  Drag the script from the project window onto the ball
  > Again, this is identical to using the **Add Component** button or the menu.  All 3 styles are interchangeable.
5. Let's test again. Enter play mode (**Ctr+P** or the Play button). Wait a second for the ball to fall onto the alley.  Now hold the spacebar and count to 3. Let go of the spacebar and the ball should roll down the alley!  As before, exiting play mode causes the scene to reset itself.
  > If the ball shoots away at high speed, or barely moves, check the mass setting in your **Rigidbody** component. The script expects something that ways around 80kg; if the weight is very different you'll see different results.
