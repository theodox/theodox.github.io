This week is devoted to the basics of scripting using Unity.  Unity supports 3 different languages, but we're going to focus on the C# language which is the most popular scripting environment.  We've already looked at some scripts, this week we'll be writing our own.


This week, in an effort to get around the wonkiness of our projector, the notes are available as a pdf file, which you can [download here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/unity%40makerhaus/week3/Unity%20Week%203.pdf).  The original powerpoint is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/unity%40makerhaus/week3/Unity%20Week%203.pptx) as well if you can use .pptx files. 

The artwork for this weeks game is avaiable for download [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/unity%40makerhaus/week3/goldfish.unitypackage).  Download the unity package to a new project and open the *Assets/fishtank/fishtank.unity* scene file to get going.
