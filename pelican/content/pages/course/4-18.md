# GUI : The weak spot

Everybody dislikes Unity's native GUI system.  The most popular replacement is **[NGui](http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140)**.  If you find the basic system too limiting it's worth checking out.

That said, the Unity system is fine for most of the basic things you need for a game: Menus, buttons, and on-screen graphics.

The big weakness of the GUI system is the way controls are set up.  GUI controls are drawn in order as the script is executed. Depending on what the user does, the script may get **reset** back to the top and **run again**.  So you have to be careful about how you structure your gui to avoid suprises.  

**Tip** *Put as *little* functionality into your **OnGUI()** code as you can. The best idea is to collect information to pass on to your **Update()** methods*

## Basics

* All components can have an **[OnGUI](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnGUI.html)** method. 
   * This gets called when the GUI is drawn
   * It may get called **several times** in one frame!
* Inside the **OnGUI**, you draw controls using the **[GUI](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.html)** class if you want to position controls precisely.  **GUI** requires that you create a **Rect** to describe each control's position
<pre>
Rect ButtonLocation = new Rect(10, 10, 150, 100); 
if (GUI.Button(ButtonLocation, "I am a button"))
            Debug.Log("You clicked the button!");
</pre>
* Or, you can lay out controls automatically using the **[GUILayout]()** class <pre>
if (GUILayout.Button("Button 1")) Debug.Log("Button");</pre>**GUILayout** controls are laid out automatically one after another
  * Usually you will create a **[GUILayout.BeginArea()](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUILayout.BeginArea.html)** to control where the automatic group is
