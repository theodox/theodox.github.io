I've been using this address to host slide copies of my 2006 GDC talk *Character Rigger's Cookbook*.  When Dropbox stopped hosting images I had to take them down temporarily. However I found an old recording of the original presentation, so rather than recreating the slides as HTML I edited the slides and the audio together and put them up on YouTube, which is a much better representation of the original talk than the slides alone.  Unfortunately the many animated examples which went with the talk have mostly fallen victim to bit rot over the years, but the overall talk is much easier to follow in this form.

*PS:* The concept of 'spaces' is a key on in the rigging business. It's a key part of the slides as well.  The ideas are discussed more thoroughly in [this article](conquest_space)
