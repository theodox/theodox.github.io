Slug: cookbook/index
Summary: Slides from the character riggers cookbook.
header_cover: cookbook_header.jpg


These are the slides for a 2-hour introductory rigging course I did at the [GameDevelopers Conference](http://gdconf.com) in 2006.  

Unfortunately the original powerpoints are lost to time and tech rot, so all I have is the jpg dump of the originals.  This makes them a bit slow the first time you cycle through, and you can't search on text.  Eventually I plan to go through and add more detaile text to the slides, but for the time being you can go to the [GDC Vault version of the original audio](http://www.gdcvault.com/search.php#&category=free&firstfocus=&keyword=character+rigging%2Bbest%2Bpractices&conference_id=) (_note: subscription required_)and follow along with the original presentation.

The concept of 'spaces' is a key on in the rigging business. It's a key part of the slides as well.  The ideas are discussed more thoroughly in [this article](conquest_space)

Anway, [here's the slides.](cookbook_01)  Enjoy!
