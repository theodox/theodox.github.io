## 1.9: Wrapping up the bowling game

The bowling game is now almost done. There are a couple of details to attend to, however. We'll add a simple way to display the score, and then adjust the camera and lighting for a better look. Finally, we'll save the game to a standalone program you can run without Unity.

### Displaying the score

1. Find the **ScoreDisplay** component in the project window. You can attach it to anything in the scene you like, but it's conventional to attach display items (such as on screen menus, HUDs or graphics) to the main camera. 
2. Check out the component in the inspector. You'll notice that it has three values: **Position**, **Rotation**, and **Scorekeeper**.  The grayed out field which says _None(Score Keeper)_ to the right of **Scorekeeper** tells us that this is an _object field_.  Unlike other controls in the inspector where you type numbers, object fields contain links to other objects in the game:

4. Click on the small circle to the right of _None(Score Keeper)_.  This will open a dialog where you can find objects of the correct type in the scene.

   > You may have to click the tab labeled 'Scene' to get the correct list. **Assets** shows files on disk (for example, a data file for use in the game), **Scene** shows items in the current scene.
5. Make sure you're looking at the 'Scene' tab. Select your trigger box. It should be the only thing listed besides 'None': Unity only shows items with ScoreKeeper components attached.  Select the trigger by double-clicking.
6. Test the game again. You should see the score in a large blue box at the upper left corner of the screen.  The ScoreKeeper component will update the score after every pin reset - it even knows to carry over scores for spares and strikes.
  > In a more elaborate game you'd want to control the font, size and color of the display. That will come up in a later lesson.

### Tweak the camera.

You can make the game easier to play with a good camera position. Moving a camera in 3 dimensions is confusing, but there's a handy trick that makes it easy.

1. First, use the navigation controls in the scene view to get a good approximation of the view you want.
2. Select the Main Camera object in your hierarchy view
3. Use **GameObject > Align with view** (**Ctrl+Shift+F**) to aim the game camera along your current view.
4. Test the game. If necessary, repeat the process until your satisfied with the camera.


### Simple lighting

We can make the scene a little more appealing by adding some lights. We'll go into more detail about lights in the next lesson, but for now we'l add a pair of lights to make the scene easier to read.

1. Create a directional light using **GameObject > Create Other > Directional light**
2. Adjust the angle of the light by rotating it with the Rotate tool (**E**)
   > You can also use **Ctrl+Shift+F** just as you did with the camera.
3. You can make the game look nicer by adding shadows. In the inspector, set the **Shadow Type** dropdown to **Soft Shadows**.
   > Shadows are very expensive to render in 3d, so many games don't use them. This game is simple enough that you can probably get away with them. If the game starts to run slowly after you turn on shadows, turn them off or set the **Resolution** dropdown to _Low Resolution_.
4. You can also add a second light to create extra highlights.  Create a point light with **GameObject > Create Other > Point light**.  Position it on the far side of the alley from the camera so it just catches the edges of the pins, helping them to stand out from the background.  You may also be able to get a nice highlight on the wood of the alley that shows the grain.
5. Since the point light is an accent light, click on the color swatch in the inspector and set the color to something that helps the pins stand out:

### Saving the game as an executable

The game is now playable. It still lacks a lot of the features of a real game - saved games, nice UI, and the ability to restart the game, to name a few - but it works. It's a tribute to the power of Unity that you can put something like this together in a few hours.  Now we'll want to save it for you to share.

1. Make sure your scene is saved: **File > Save Scene**
1. Go to the Build Setting dialog: **File > Build Settings...** (**Ctrl+Shift+B**):
  <p/>![build](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2977490/Unity%40makerhaus/gfx/Screenshot%202013-10-12%2023.33.36.png)
2. You need to let Unity know that you want to include your current scene. Click the button on the right side just below the top panel labeled 'Add Current' to include your scene in the build.
3. Choose **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone** from the list at lower left 
   > Some options, such as publishing to Xbox or iPhone, are not possible with the free trial version of Unity.  Select your operating system from the dropdown at right.
4. Click 'Build and Run' to save a copy of your program and run it. You'll be prompted for a save location and a few seconds later you'll get a dialog prompting you for graphics settings. Select a resolution that will fit on your monitor and your ready to play!
   > It's a good idea to choose 'windowed' - we did not add any logic for quitting the game, so without the close box in a window you'll have a hard time getting out of the game!


### Things to think about for next time

This is about the simplest game imaginable, but there is a lot of room for creativity. Consider how could you spice up the game without extra programming, just by adding more content with the techniques you've learned today. Here are a few ideas to ponder:

* Change the models for the bowling ball and pins.  Bowling zombie heads? Knocking over Lava Lamps?

* Add obstacles to the lane: Placing objects with colliders on the lane can make for some interesting challenges. 

* How can you use different camera angles to make the game more interesting - or more difficult?

* You could create multiple scenes with different and more challenging arrangements of pins

* How about an irregularly shaped ball? Heavier pins? Or bowling with a constant side wind?


There' also some more mundane areas for improvement:

* Better scoring graphics

* More atmosphere - a full 3-d bowling alley

* Adding english to the ball with the mouse wheel or other keys.

As you can see, even without a lot of code there is a lot of room for creativity.  As you get more confident with graphics and programming you'll have even more options.
