### Scripting basics 2:  What is programming?

* Computers are very stupid
* They do exactly what you tell them
   * ... instead of what you want
* Computer languages are stilted and awkward so they are more precise than literal languages.

In English you might say I saw a couple of kids hanging around the McDonalds In c# you would say:

    location mcDs = new location(McDonalds, 37, 45);
    punk[] kids = new punk[] { kid1, kid2 };
    foreach (child k in kids)
       k.location = mcDs;
    } 

Most of the effort here is specifying that "mcDs" is a location and the the kids are kids.  This seems like a lot of work - but it prevents problems like this typo:

     foreach (child k in kids)
     {
         k.location = k;
     }
