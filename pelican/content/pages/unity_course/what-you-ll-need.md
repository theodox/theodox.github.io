Here's what you'll need to bring to class:

###Your own laptop.
Unity's recommended system requirements are found [here](http://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements); basically what you'll need is a fairly modern laptop ideally with a decent graphics card. Luckily Unity is designed to work on a range of hardware, from game consoles all the way down to older smartphones, so most laptops should be adequate. 

And of course you'll need to [install Unity](http://unity3d.com/unity/download).  It's a good idea to do this before the first class so we aren't all competing for bandwidth and watching progress bars.

###A Mouse
It's probably a good idea to bring a mouse, even if you usually use a trackpad, 3d navigation and the Unity UI are much friendlier if you have a mouse.  A mouse with a scroll wheel is best.

### Your power cord!
Running Unity on a laptop is tends to be a serious batter hog - bring your adapter for when the juice runs out.
