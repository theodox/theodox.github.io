# Handling Other Keys

Sometimes you'll want to just look for special  presses, rather than using an axis.

* Requires less setup and is good for testing.  
* Allows you to test separately for the press, hold and release of a particular key

To check a key use **Input.GetKeyDown**, **Input.GetKeyUp**, and **Input.GetKey**

* **GetKeyDown** is true once, when the key is pressed
* **GetKey** is true as long the key is held down 
* **GetKeyUp** is true once, when the key is released

To get a particular key, the Input class defines special codes for each key.  To catch an A, for example, you'd use<pre>Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A)</pre>There are codes for special keys like 'tab' or 'insert' (the [complete list is here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html))
