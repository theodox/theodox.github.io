## 1.2 Creating the bowling alley

1. Make a cube using **GameObject > Create Other > Cube**
2. Name it "Lane" (or something similar so you can find it in your hierarchy window) 
3. Using the scale tool (**R key**) to scale the lane to (2,.2, 12) or something close to that. Check your numbers in the inspector window.  If you're way off in space, use the **F Key** to frame the cube.
   > You may find it easier to locate yourself in space if you turn on the 3-d grid display in your scene window.  The small button on the top bar of the window that looks like a picture in a frame toggles the grid on and off.
4. Using the move tool, move the lane to a position like (0, -.1, 5). By moving it down .1 units, we're certain that the top of the cube is at Y=0. 
5. In your project window, find the **Standard Assets** folder. Inside there, find the **Materials** folder. 
6. In the Materials folder, find the material called **alley** (remember: _materials_ are shown as balls; _textures_ are squares).
7. Drag the alley material on to your cube. It should look something like this:
