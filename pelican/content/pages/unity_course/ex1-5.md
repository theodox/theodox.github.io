## 1.5 Add a pin model

Now we're going to place a bowling pin model.  We'll also cover how to change import settings for models coming into Unity from other programs.

1. In your project window, find the **Standard Assets** folder, and inside it the **bowling pin** folder.  Locate the bowling pin model - it looks like, suprise, a bowling pin.  If you expand the icon using the little triangle button you'll see it includes a model and an 'Avatar' - an animation controller. 
2. When models come in to Unity, we use the import settings to control how they are handled by the game. Select the bowling pin model and check the inspector: you should see the details about how the model is brought in to the game:

3. In this case, we don't want to animate the bowling pin - that will be handled with physics. So click on the 'Rig' tab in the inspector and set the animation type to 'None'.  Then click the 'apply' button.  If you check the icon's contents in the project window again, you'll see that the avatar is now gone.
   > The avatar would not cause problems but it's unnecessary clutter. It's a good idea to manually check the import settings the first time you bring any model into Unity - once set, they will retain your choices even if you edit the model outside Unity.
2. Drag the bowling pin model from the project window to the hierarchy window. You should see it appear at the far end of the alley.
   > When you place a model by dragging into the hierarchy window, they appear at location (0,0,0). If you drag them directly into the scene window, they show up where you drop them. However, Unity does a poor job of figuring out where you really want them in 3d - often a move of the camera shows that the model has shown up much closer to the camera than you'd expect.
3. Use the **Component** menu or the **Add Component** button in the inspector to add a Rigidbody. 
4. Check the mass setting of the Rigidbody in the inspector, and make sure it's 1 or close to 1.
5. Move the pin up by a small amount with the Move tool (**W**). A value of y = .1 is about right.
  > The offset is to make sure that Unity doesn't think the pin is interpenetrating the floor. If two physics objects start the scene intersecting each other, they won't know how to collide with each other when the simulation runs.
6. Test again.  Activate play mode (**Ctrl+P**) and use the space bar to throw the ball and see if you hit the pin. If you're having trouble, the left and right arrow keys will nudge the ball left and right.
7. Your ball went right through the pin without knocking it over. The pin does not have a [collider](glossary#component) to tell the physics system how to handle collisions. So add a **CapsuleCollider** using the same techniques we've already covered.
  > You could also use a BoxCollider, but the pins would not roll when knocked over. You might also use a MeshCollider, which more closely resembles the shape of the pin. This would look better, but it's also more work for the physics system.

8. Test again - now the pin should be knocked over by the ball.
