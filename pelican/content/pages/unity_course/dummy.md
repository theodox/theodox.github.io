# Checking for 3d objects

Checking against the scene uses a ray from the camera and testing it against the world.

* For this to work the objects you're checking need to have colliders
* **[OnMouseEnter](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseEnter.html)** fires on an object when the mouse passes over an object
* **[OnMouseExit](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseExit.html)** fires when the mouse leaves an object it was previously over
