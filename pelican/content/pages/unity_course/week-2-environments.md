### Week 2: 3D graphics and animation ###

This week we're going to focus on the basics of 3d rendering, animation and sound in Unity. 

Most of the hard work in this area is actually done in other programs like [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview) and [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) for modeling, [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features-com&siclientid=6381&sessguid=dbd60035-c8ca-405c-a4d1-99eb691bec55&userguid=dbd60035-c8ca-405c-a4d1-99eb691bec55&permguid=dbd60035-c8ca-405c-a4d1-99eb691bec55) for audio and so on.  We've already covered the basics of bringing outside [assets](Glossary#assets) into Unity, this week we want to move on to a slightly more advanced level so you can get the looks you want.

The first hour will cover 3d rendering - how it works and what Unity can and can't do for you. We'll also touch on [budgeting](Glossary#budget): the process of figuring out how much stuff you can get into your game before it starts to slow down and run erratically.

The second hour will cover animation. Both classical and computer animation are big topics -- worthy of a [whole course](http://www.animationmentor.com/) on their own! -- so we'll focus more on the tech side than the aesthetics. Most games involve a **lot** of animation that doesn't require a Disney background, and understanding what you can (and can't) do inside of Unity is a big help.

The last hour will focus on audio. Again, making good sounds and music are way out of scope for this class - but we'll show you how to import and hook up audio.
