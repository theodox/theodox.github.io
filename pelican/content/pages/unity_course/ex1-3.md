## 1.3 Add a bowling ball

1. Now create a sphere using **GameObject > Create Other> Sphere**. Rename it to 'ball' or 'bowling ball'.
2. Using the scale tool (**R**) scale the ball down to about half size. Check the values in the inspector: the scale should be close to (.5, .5, .5).
3. Using the move tool (**W**) or the inspector, position the sphere at the end of the bowling lane. Use the view cube or the view menu (just below the cube) to look at the scene from the 'front' camera: you ball should be on the left side of the screen, and a little bit above the surface of the alley.
