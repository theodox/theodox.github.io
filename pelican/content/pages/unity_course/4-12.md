# Key Input (cont'd)
5. In the **Update** method:<pre>
Color current = BaseColor;
int active = 1;
foreach(ColorKey k in ColorKeys)
{
if (Input.GetKey(k.Code))
      {
      current += k.Color;
      active +=  1;
      } 
}
renderer.material.color = current / active;</pre>
2. Save, check for errors, and return to Unity
3. Apply your component to the cube in your scene.
4. Add some Key-Color combinations. First set the **Size** of the **Color Keys** field to something bigger than zero, than choose keys and colors for each entry.
5. Run. Try pressing some of the keys you defined in the component. What happens? This code loops through all the key-color pairs you have in your component. It adds in the color for each key you press (try pressing multiple keys at once).

This example shows two good tricks:

* Using a custom class to bind related pieces of data together. Unity makes it easy to create simple collections of different data using **System.Serializable** and basic classes.
* Checking for concurrent inputs on multiple key presses at once by using a loop instead of a long series of **if/then** statements.
