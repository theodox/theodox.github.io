##Software
<a id="extras"/>


Here are a few free or cheap resources that you'll find useful when working on your own outside the classroom.

###[Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/) 
![sketchup](http://www.thinkdigit.com/uploads/dnldImg198x166_1320329232.png)<br>
A free 3d modeling program from Google.  It can export models which Unity can display. It's a fairly painless way to get into 3d modeling, although it's not much use for characters or animations.  While Sketchup lessons are outside the scope of this class, there are [good tutorials](http://www.sketchup.com/learn) available the the program is very friendly (as 3d modelling goes, anyway). Sketchup is available for Windows and OSX.

###[Blender](http://www.blender.org) 
![blender](http://wiki.blender.org/uploads/thumb/d/d3/Blender25withbbb.jpg/300px-Blender25withbbb.jpg)<br>
A free, full-featured modeling and animation program that competes with professional tools.  Blender models can be exported into [FBX](Glossary/#FBX) format for use in Unity.  Blender is available for Windows, Linux and OSX.

###[CGTextures.com](http://www.cgtextures.com/) 
![cgtextures](http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2008/06/cg-textures.png)
A website with lots and lots of royalty free photo textures which are correctly sized, cropped and edited for game applications.  You can get a free account which allows a limited number of downloads per day, or a paid account with much higher limits.

###[TurboSquid](http://www.turbosquid.com/)
![turbosquid](http://makingsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/turbosquid-e1373474002287.png)<br>
Turbosquid sells 3d models and textures of all varieties (and, unfortunately, qualities). While they aren't free, they can be a useful way to fill up your game world quickly - and some prices are quite low. Use models in **.obj** or **.fbx** format.

###If you have money to spare....

[3dSMax](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-3ds-max/overview)  and [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview) Are the leading commercial packages modeling and animation - both are very powerful (and very expensive).  The do however include free trials.

For image editing, [Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) is the professional tool of choice. However you can use any program that edits standard image formats -- look for software that can save files as .PNG, .TIF, or .TGA files. 

If you want to do realistic graphics, [Crazybump](http://www.crazybump.com/) is a very handy tool for creating [normal maps](http://vimeo.com/6155447).  [Xnormal](http://www.xnormal.net/1.aspx) is another normal mapping tool, however it works by comparing the difference between high and low resolution versions of the same model.
