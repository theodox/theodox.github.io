### Game architecture basics

A **State machine** is the usual way of representing what's going in a complex system.

* An arbitrary set of states
  * States are mutually exclusive - only one is active at a time
  * Switch between states in a deterministic way
  * Each state sets itself up and cleans up after itself
* Usual unity implementation: 1 state = 1 level
