# Using Textures

You can also use textures for GUI elements instead of text.

* Textures are represented by the **[Texture2d](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html)** class. 
* Usually you will assign textures to fields in the inspector, just like you would with gameObjects, transforms or other object references.

### Texture-friendly controls:

These controls accept Textures in the same place as the text layouts we've been using:

* **[Box](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Box.html)** Good for just showing pictures
* **[Button](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Button.html)** 
* **[Label](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Label.html)** 
* **[Toggle](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.Toggle.html)** 

### Drawing textures directly

You can also draw a texture directly without creating a clickable control.  You can use 

* **[DrawTexture](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.DrawTexture.html)** Draws a texture at a specified **Rect**
* **[DrawTextureWithTexCoords](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords.html)** Lets you scale or repeat the texture

These functions are not available in **GUILayout**.
