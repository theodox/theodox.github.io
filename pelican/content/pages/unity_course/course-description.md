Unity 3d is one of the most popular tools for game developers. It offers a rich set of features for 3D rendering, animation, physics, and web  features, and can publish games on PCs, consoles, websites and mobile  devices.

This course is an introduction to Unity covering basic techniques for creating games in Unity.  The course will cover all the basic techniques needed to create games in Unity. We'll cover:

*  Importing Images, 3d-models and animations into Unity games

* Creating environments in 2d and 3d using Unity's built-in editor

* Adding GUI elements such as menus and player controls

* Using Unity's 3d rendering system to create lighting and material effects

* Creating basic game logic using the C# language

* Adding animations, physics and sounds.

Along the way also learn the basic survival skills that every game developer  needs: problem solving, agile design, and the art of cutting corners.   At the end  of the class everyone involved should have a modest but functional 3d game of their own.

We'll be programming in C#, so students will be more  comfortable and productive if they have at least basic programming experience. We'll cover elementary 3d math, so basic algebra and trigonometry is also  helpful.
