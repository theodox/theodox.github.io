#Input Axis: Mouse

1. Stop the scene for a moment and go to the InputManager (**Edit >> Project Settings >> Input**).  *You may find it handy to use the lock icon at top right to keep it open for this exercise .*
2. Try changing the *gravity* setting in the Vertical axis to 0.  Run the game again and see how the cube behaves differently with no code changes
   * The gravity setting will 'pull' the axis value back towards zero if the user stops inputting. 
   * Large values pull faster, small values pull slower
   * 0 turns the effect off
3. Reset the *gravity* to 3
4. Change the axis so it uses mouse movement by setting *type* to **Mouse Movement**.
5. Run the game again, and move your mouse cursor up and down. What happens now?
6. Stop the game and reopen the Input manager. Change the *Sensitivity* value to **.25** and re-run the game.
   * When using mouse or joystick as an axis, *Sensitivity* scales the value coming in. In the case of a mouse, you want low values since the incoming numbers represent dozens of pixels for each frame.
7. The game is less jittery, but still jumps a lot. In the next exercise we'll try to smooth it out.
