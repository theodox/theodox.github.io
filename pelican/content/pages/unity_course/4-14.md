# Mouse interactions with objects

There is a  family of methods you can add to components to let them interact with objects.

For these to work the objects you're checking **must  have colliders.**  How accurately the mouse tracks the object depends on the shape of the collider.

### Checking mouse movement (no buttons)
* **[OnMouseEnter](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseEnter.html)** fires when the mouse crosses over the collider of your object
* **[OnMouseExit](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseExit.html)** fires when the mouse leaves the collider of your object
* **[OnMouseOver](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseOver.html)** fires every frame  while the mouse is over the object

**Note** *The timing of **OnMouseEnter**, **OnMouseExit**, and **OnMouseOver** corresponds to **GetKeyDown**, **GetKeyUp** and **GetKey** * 
### Clicks and Drags 

* **[OnMouseDown](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseDown.html)** is called on the frame when the mouse is pressed over your object
* **[OnMouseDrag](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseDrag.html)** fires when the mouse is held down and moved over your object
* **[OnMouseUp](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUp.html)**  fires when the mouse is released.
* **[OnMouseUpAsButton](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUpAsButton.html)** fires when the mouse is up but **only** if that same object also recieved an **OnMouseDown** call. This guarantees that the mouse stayed inside the button between click and release.
