# About the blog

It's a blog about technical art, particularly Maya, Python, and Unity. With lots of obscurantist references thrown in for my own amusement.

# About the Author

I fell in love with computer animation in the Dark Ages, in more ways than one: I dropped out of a Ph.D. program in ancient history to start rendering 3D scenes on the Brown University mainframe back in the wee early 1990's.  I went pro in 1993, doing animations for a variety of commercial and television projects.

My first game job was building mechs and environments for FASA's MechCommander in 1995.

In the subsequent decades(!) I've been very lucky to fall in with some great projects.  I was an artist and animator on *Half-Life, Team Fortress Classic, Team Fortress 2* and *Counter-Strike* at Valve. I gradually moved from production art to focusing on tools and pipelines, first as the artist-in-residence for the *Granny* animation system, then as the technical art manager at Zipper Interactive (*SOCOM 3* and *SOCOM M.A.G.*).  I was technical art director at Bungie (*Halo 3* and *Halo ODST*). 

I'm currently the technical art director for Undead Labs (*State of Decay*).
