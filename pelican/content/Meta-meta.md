Long time readers will know that I have an obsession with [Python metaclasses](back link) I just found an [excellent article](http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Metaprogramming.html) which lays out many of the interesting, subtle possiblitities and potential pitfalls of working with metaclasses, and it also has an excellent set of extra links for further reading.  Although the owning site is about Python 3, this article is mostly 2.X and always calls out the differences between version 2 and version 3 syntax.  Recommended for fellow metaclass maniacs!
