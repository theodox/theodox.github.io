Summary: Announcing a new permalist page of interesting graphics and animation research

I've added a permanent [page to keep track of interesting academic research](pages/interesting-graphics-and-animation.html). It's over in the sidebar.  If you're at all into animation, download the videos or the ppt of the [paper on gait optimization](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/). It's fun -- unless you're an animator, in which case it's a bit scary.   
  
The list is a bit skimpy atm, I'll post updates as it expands.
