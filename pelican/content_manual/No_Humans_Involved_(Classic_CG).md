Summary: pending

Saw a [great paper](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~geijt101/papers/SA2013/)
in [+Robert Butterworth](https://plus.google.com/116275833090172173559) 's
feed which reminded me of this classic SIGGRAPH presentation from 1994 - one
of the all time greats in procedural animation.  None of the motion in this
was animated by hand :)
