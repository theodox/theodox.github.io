Still on holiday blogging wise, as we ponder the year gone by, give a thought
to these ancient nuggets from [Robert
Abel](http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/abel.html), back from when I
was still in high school :)  Back when being a 'technical artist' probably
meant 'being the guy who can hand adjust the laser in the slide-rendering
machine that produces our graphics on film'
