Summary: pending

Here's a [very complete source for a variety of python package binary distributions](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/), covering a pretty
broad variety of platforms, python versions and bit depths.  A good page to
bookmark next time your scrounging for a rare extension module you can't
compile.
