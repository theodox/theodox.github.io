One of the peculiar pleasures of TA life is the fact that most of us get
rewarded traits which are not always valued in other jobs.  If you are a TA,
the odds are pretty good that you are curious to the point of distraction
about how things work. It's also a good bet that you find the idea of doing
things "better" perversely compelling, so much so that you spend a lot of time
on honing your ways of doing things even when your current routine is more or
less adequate.  
  
  
In general this is a trait which serves us well.  Over time, all the extra
energy we pour into poking at things and seeing how they work is well
rewarded.  Its why we are the folks who know all the obscure features in Max
and Maya which nobody else bothered to learn; it's why we know how to troll
through all those log files to figure out why things don't work in our games;
its why we can be relied on to ferret out the one teensy little difference
between the one file that that crashes an artist's machine and the hundreds of
similar ones.  
  
Sometimes, though, this beneficial quirk of personality turns into an
unhealthy obsession, You set off on a mission and end up chasing some kind of
"better way" so far that you completely lose sight of your actual objectives.
I had a bad case today, where I let a relatively simple bit of UI code
degenerate into an overwrought exercise in  data binding paradig
