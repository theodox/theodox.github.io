Summary: The _other_ Pythonistas are wearing money hats

I've frequently commented in the past on the [Game Developers Salary Survey](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/221533/Game_Developer_Salary_Survey_2014_The_results_are_in.php).  For you Pythonistas out there, there's some nice data
(amateur grade, but still pretty good) to be found at the [Python Developer Salary Survey](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/agilevic/pystreet/blob/master/notebooks/PyStreet%20Python%20Developer%20Salary%20Survey%20Results.ipynb).
No mention of what you get for knowing Max / Maya, however, but by crunching
the numbers I'd guess it _subtracts_ about $30k per year.  
  
Or maybe that's just because we're all lousy programmers.
