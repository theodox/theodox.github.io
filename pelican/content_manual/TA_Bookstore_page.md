Summary: pending

I've started a [page](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/p/bookstore.html)
with links to books that TA's would find interesting or useful. Let me know if
you've got recommendations - right now there's a glaring lack of Max related
books. I've been skipping over "How to do X in Max 2011" type titles so far
since they get dated so quickly (I've got probably 200 lbs of utterly useless
reference on versions of Maya and Max that wouldn't even run on Windows 7
stuffed into my basement). But I'm always interested to hear about useful
reference stuff.
