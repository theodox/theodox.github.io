# WORK IN PROGRESS

I'm reworking this page right now as I transition over to
[MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io) - which, I should say, is awesome. So,
right now this is pretty much placeholder (the nav bar is pretty rudimentary,
for example)

The main item here at the moment is the [Character Riggers'
Cookbook](///E://Users/Stephen%20Theodore/theodox.github.io/cookbook/index.md)
slide deck from GDC.

In the meantime, you might find something useful on my
[blog](http://blog.theodox.com)

    
    
    def test():  
        print 999  
        for item in (1, 2) : print item * 3
