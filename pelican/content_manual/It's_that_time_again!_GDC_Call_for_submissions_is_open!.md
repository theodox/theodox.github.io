Authors: Steve Theodore
Summary: pending

It's time again for GDC speakers to submit their proposals.  TA's have a long
history of providing excellent talks at the main conference and at the Tech
Art Bootcamp - so take some time to put together a proposal for this year's
conference.  
  
For more on why this is a Good Ideatm, check out [last year's post on the same
topic](http://techartsurvival.blogspot.com/2014/08/submit.html).  One
important note! This year the call for subs closes on August 27, **NOT**
August 28 as it is in the linked post !
