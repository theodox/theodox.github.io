gdc 2015 notes
=============

certain affinity perf talk
-----
Thye had a nice system for gpu and cpu budgets.  They had cameras at fixed points in the level and ran daily stats on all of them.  They budgeted 13 ms for environment w/o players.  Ran reports every day.

Same thing for CPU looking for stalls

Did model subdivisions for big vistas, we could maybe steal that



Certain affinity proceduralism talk
---
* they used a masked material pipe instead of a per-pixel peint job
* "One button pipeline" 
	- Zbrush to game in one shot
	- Traditional:
		- High > Game > Back maps > Materials > game
	- Zbrush high res with material masks
	- They use decimation from Houdini to do the remeshing
		- Generate voxelized game res meshes
		- Remesh them
		- Xnormal to bak AO, Curvature
			- Substance has a batch baker for command line (!!!) 
	- substnce player to map materials onto original colors
	- They share this pipe between UE and Halo 
		- the last step is done by the pipeline
		- all the deterministic steps are automated
	- try to see the followup talk from Mike Pavlovich
* Procedural blocks
	- Used houdini to generate block librares
	- these could be procedurally expanded
* they did do their own shader inside of substance
	- 

Katz - Elder scrolls pipelinel
---
-  Max rig; no good reference system
-- didn't use biped
-- moved to scriptable rig system
-- lots of multple parentage (eg, feet are world body)


Substance 
---
* 50 AAA projects
* houdini. c4d integrations this week
* 10-15k users
* polycount contest
* Painter notes
	* Baking in UI
		- bakes all the maps (even user supplied ones like AO)
		- they definitely want the export dlg to be the packing step, more or less like we want to do.  If we can just get rid of the dds constraint (or make them support dds ) we're on the right track.
* Designer Notes
	- relic texture pipeline with substance
	- substance 'batch tools'
	- have python calls
	- this could be our texture hook.... <<<<
	- Relic (eg) seems to have a js-based photoshop exporter like the one we thought about....
	- it talks to substance batch to handle dependency issues.
	- Python calls for substance operations
		- all callbacks have to be async or you get icky issues
		- version control menu
	- looks like relic is making this totally critical path... if we go material map this might be true for us too...
	- Susbstance can send non-blocking messages in the processng....
	- relic code is up on github <<<

Tomorrow's children
----
* realtime GI and terrain system
* voxel cone tracing (Siggraph 2011) / SVO
	- cone tracing vs rays
	- cones intesect with multiple, partial hits.
	- method is less accurate but less noisy than tracing
	- walk a series of spherical voxel samples
		- they add them up so they are often too generous

	- instead of svo, they did a voxel cascade
	- they had a voxel g-buffer (albedo, emission, coverage, etc)
	- voxel buffers were stored per face 
	- 6 cascades of 32^3 voxels X 6 faces
	- all textures into a single 192 x 192 x 32  texture
	- gi path
		- voxelize 
			- 16x supersample
		- cone trace to get light (how much occlusion though voxels)
			- cone traces happen in 16 limited directions
			-light injections
				- sky
				- point light
				- sky and points injected into another cascaded map
				- emission
				- light textures are recycled over frames
			- final cone trace is done in screen space
				- lights are basically a low res shadow map
				- 1/16 th size maps			
		- update 1 cascade level per frame
		- closest one runs more often
		- scroll the existing textures if camera moves
		- use lower cascades to fill anymissing geo
		- use low LOD for voxelize
		- GI looks up into the light textures
		- all of the above is 10 ms -- toooo slow
		- optmizations
			- 16 fixed directions lets you predefine voxel face blends
			- far cascades are interpolated in textures at farther cascades, not traced
			- SSDO (directoinal) - 
				- spherical harmonic intersection with the 16 cones
			- use capsules for the character
		- particles:
			- volume SH sample
		- Subsurface scattering can also use the point irradiance
* Lanscape
	- voxel representaton
	-Dual countouring re-constructon
	- dual contouring treats 2x2 voxel array instead of solo
	- "Efficient and high quality contouring of isosurfaces on uniform grids" papers
	- "Beautifier" - renders the non-voxel version over the voxelized one
		- use depth buffer to blend results, preferring prettier where possible
* Whole thing runs in asynccompute
	- lots of parellelization

Ubisoft tools
---
- basics
	- identify user
	- do one thing well
		- fewer features, but do them really well.
	- "Don't listen to users"
		- watch, not ask  <<<<<<<<
		- filter feedback  <<<<<<<
			- get to the real underlying problem
	- They saved 7 man-mo (get this example off the vault, it's great
- focus!
	- over-emphasize the needs of the majority  <<<<<<
	- advanced features can be hidden
	- make things clear
	- logs, auto-emails. etc
- you're not going to make everybody happy
- UX Experts
	- "Task Flow"
	- actions are watched and times
	- id things which can be caught, removed.
- UI
	- lots of multiple iterations of the same basic idea = bad....
	- wheel reinvention
	- consistent options
	- things like ok and cancel placement matter
	- clicking on eggshells <- nice metaphor
	- consistent terms
		- find vs search
		- shared icons for different functions
	- UI is only already learned and not-yet-learned
- shared vision
	- tools are used lots of different ways
	- think use, not features
	- "not talking of the same thing"
		- do you speak the same language? About the same things?
		- mockups and visualisations
	- verbal agreements < visualizations
	- MOCKUPS
- understand context
	- 	 	

Martin - content optimization pipeline
---
- they had about 500k enitities
- lots of optimization need
- SQL back end generated by trolling level files
- reports generated > good docs spreadsheets
- heat map of placements
- lots of random stuff found
	- found meshes, animated props, huge lights, and meshes w/o lods
- data was taken from the build
- google docs api limiting

Ubi tools pipeline optimization
===========================
- they were getting killed by network access
- switched to part-by-part manifests with changes
- cut down net traffic by 90% + 
- also allows for long history of builds (1 year +)
- only 5 %  of pkg changes between builds
- further, virtualize the file system so game client downloads latest bits as needed
- most users hit less than 1% of content every day!
- diffs on a separate fast server from the actual data
- "RTPal" virtualization shared by xbox, pc, etc
