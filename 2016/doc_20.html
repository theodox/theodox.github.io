  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I noticed recently that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1936075/theodox">StackOverflow</a> is trying to encourage community documentation. The tagline they&#8217;re using is &#8220;Let&#8217;s do for documentation what we did for <span class="caps">QA</span>,&#8221; which immediately made the cynical side of my brain think &#8220;like, turn it into a brogrammer mud-wrestling&nbsp;match?&#8221; </p>
<p>Kidding aside, documentation is something I&#8217;ve gotten to be very uptight about. Maybe it&#8217;s just having spent a the better part of a year having to maintain somebody else&#8217;s code. Maybe its the whiplash I&#8217;ve gotten from hopping between 3 game engines in 5 years.  Or maybe I&#8217;m just setting into my grumpy old man persona and I want to stop answering the same questions about how to attach a control to a <code>formLayout</code>.  But the idea of a good, relatively up-to-date community documentation is really appealing to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>One of the things that really jumped out at me in the initial pitch on StackOverflow was the&nbsp;sentence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Documentation] was usually written once, often by someone not even using the technology, so it was a guess at what to focus&nbsp;on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which really rang true: I&#8217;ve generally run into only two different kinds of documentation: slick, well written and shallow &#8212; or spotty and inadequate. Those are not great alternatives.  Easily 7 times out of 10 I end up on StackOverflow it&#8217;s precisely because I&#8217;ve found another hole in somebody&#8217;s&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<p>The idea that <span class="caps">SO</span> is pushing is effectively a kind of Wikipedia for their different communities: They want users to put together the building blocks and also to edit each other&#8217;s works &#8212; voting things up and down and editing them collaboratively more or less the way they do with <span class="caps">SO</span>&nbsp;questions. </p>
<p>To get a sense of where this is headed, you can check out the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/topics">Python documentation page</a>.  </p>
<p>To me it doesn&#8217;t feel quite right just yet: the examples are fine on their own but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d know how to assemble them into a coherent picture if I didn&#8217;t already know roughly how they fit together. On the other hand this is still new: give it a couple of years, with the incredible amount of free labor that the internet&#8217;s reputation economy provides, and I can see it being as good as the double-whammy of Unity&#8217;s docs and answer platforms.  It&#8217;s particularly appealing to have a single place where a community can put the perennials: so many <span class="caps">SO</span> questions are just repeats of old questions where for some reason the asker hasn&#8217;t figured out the magic combinations of search terms to find the pre-existing answers.  I hope that a good community doc site, with input from lots of people who know their way around, would produce a lot of folks who could efficiently route the clueless to the information &#8212; the answer might really lie less in the docs themselves than in creating a culture of people who knew roughly where to send people for authoritative&nbsp;info.</p>
<p>With that in mind I&#8217;d like to point out that there are currently only two people signed up to do documentation for Maya programming on <span class="caps">SO</span> &#8212; the site requires a minimum of five user before it will open a documentation site for a given topic.  I think it would be great if the <span class="caps">TA</span> community led the way in getting the Maya documentation project into good shape.  Not only would we all benefit from the information directly, we&#8217;d also have a chance to point new entrants in the field to a common source of knowledge that we all share in &#8212; over time I can see it becoming an important part of onboarding new <span class="caps">TA</span>&#8217;s into the&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>Plus, if it really works I can stop answering all those &#8216;how do I make this button update this field in Maya&#8217; questions once and for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>So, whaddya say gang? Who&#8217;s with&nbsp;me?</p>
